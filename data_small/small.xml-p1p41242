'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[Political movement|movement]] that is skeptical of all justifications for [[authority]] and seeks to abolish the [[institutions]] they claim maintain unnecessary [[coercion]] and [[Social hierarchy|hierarchy]], typically including, though not necessarily limited to, the [[State (polity)|state]]{{sfn|Suissa|2019b|ps=: &quot;...as many anarchists have stressed, it is not government as such that they find objectionable, but the hierarchical forms of government associated with the nation state.&quot;}} and [[capitalism]]. Anarchism advocates for the replacement of the state with [[Stateless society|stateless societies]] or other forms of [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free associations]]. As a historically [[left-wing]] movement, usually placed on the [[Far-left politics|farthest left]] of the [[political spectrum]], it is usually described alongside [[Communalism (Bookchin)|communalism]] and [[libertarian Marxism]] as the [[libertarian]] wing ([[libertarian socialism]]) of the [[socialist movement]].

[[Humans]] lived in [[society|societies]] without formal hierarchies long before the establishment of formal states, [[realm]]s, or [[empire]]s. With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, [[scepticism]] toward authority also rose. Although traces of anarchist thought are found throughout history, modern anarchism emerged from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers' struggles for [[emancipation]]. Various [[anarchist schools of thought]] formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the [[Paris Commune]], the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]], whose end marked the end of the [[classical era of anarchism]]. In the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more.

Anarchism employs a [[diversity of tactics]] in order to meet its ideal ends which can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics; there is significant overlap between the two, which are merely descriptive. Revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state, having taken a violent turn in the past, while evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like. Anarchist thought, criticism, and [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] have played a part in diverse areas of human society.

[[File:WilhelmWeitling.jpg|thumb|[[Wilhelm Weitling]] is an example of a writer who added to anarchist theory without using the exact term.{{sfn|Carlson|1972|pp=22–23}}]]
The etymological origin of ''anarchism'' is from the Ancient Greek ''anarkhia'', meaning &quot;without a ruler&quot;, composed of the prefix ''an-'' (&quot;without&quot;) and the word ''arkhos'' (&quot;leader&quot; or &quot;ruler&quot;). The suffix ''[[-ism]]'' denotes the ideological current that favours [[anarchy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bates|1y=2017|1p=128|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2p=217}} ''Anarchism'' appears in English from 1642 as ''anarchisme'' and ''anarchy'' from 1539; early English usages emphasised a sense of disorder.{{sfnm|1a1=Merriam-Webster|1y=2019|1loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;|2a1=''Oxford English Dictionary''|2y=2005|2loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;|3a1=Sylvan|3y=2007|3p=260}} Various factions within the [[French Revolution]] labelled their opponents as ''anarchists'', although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as [[William Godwin]] (1756–1836) and [[Wilhelm Weitling]] (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but did not use ''anarchist'' or ''anarchism'' in describing themselves or their beliefs.{{sfn|Joll|1964|pp=27–37}}

The first political philosopher to call himself an ''anarchist'' ({{lang-fr|anarchiste}}) was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France,{{sfn|Nettlau|1996|p=162}} ''[[libertarianism]]'' has often been used as a synonym for anarchism{{sfn|Guérin|1970|loc=&quot;The Basic Ideas of Anarchism&quot;}} and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Ward|1y=2004|1p=62|2a1=Goodway|2y=2006|2p=4|3a1=Skirda|3y=2002|3p=183|4a1=Fernández|4y=2009|4p=9}} Some usages of ''libertarianism'' refer to [[individualistic]] [[free-market]] philosophy only, and [[free-market anarchism]] in particular is termed ''libertarian anarchism''.{{sfn|Morris|2002|p=61}}

While the term ''libertarian'' has been largely synonymous with anarchism,{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1p=641|2a1=Cohn|2y=2009|2p=6}} its meaning has more recently diluted with wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups,{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} including both the [[New Left]] and [[libertarian Marxists]], who do not associate themselves with [[authoritarian socialists]] or a [[vanguard party]], and extreme [[cultural liberals]], who are primarily concerned with [[civil liberties]].{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} Additionally, some anarchists use ''[[libertarian socialist]]''{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1p=641|2a1=Chomsky|2y=2005|2p=123|3a1=Cohn|3y=2009|3p=6|4a1=Levy|4a2=Adams|4y=2018|4p=104}} to avoid anarchism's negative connotations and emphasise its connections with [[socialism]].{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} ''Anarchism'' is broadly used to describe the [[anti-authoritarian]] wing of the [[socialist movement]].{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=104}}{{refn|In ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' (1970),{{sfn|Guérin|1970|p=12}} anarchist historian [[Daniel Guérin]] described it as a synonym for [[libertarian socialism]], and wrote that anarchism &quot;is really a synonym for socialism. The anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man. Anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought, that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the State.&quot;{{sfn|Arvidsson|2017}} In his many works on anarchism, such as ''Chomsky on Anarchism'' (2005),{{sfn|Chomsky|2005|p=123}} historian [[Noam Chomsky]] describes anarchism, alongside [[libertarian Marxism]], as the [[libertarian]] wing of [[socialism]].{{sfn|Otero|1994|p=617}}|group=nb}} Anarchism is contrasted to socialist forms which are state-oriented or from above.{{sfn|Osgood|1889|p=1}} Scholars of anarchism generally highlight anarchism's socialist credentials{{sfn|Newman|2005|p=15}} and criticise attempts at creating dichotomies between the two.{{sfn|Morris|2015|p=64}} Some scholars describe anarchism as having many influences from [[liberalism]],{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} and being both liberals and socialists but more so,{{sfn|Walter|2002|p=44}} while most scholars reject [[anarcho-capitalism]] as a misunderstanding of anarchist principles.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1pp=564–565|2a1=Jennings|2y=1993|2p=143|3a1=Gay|3a2=Gay|3y=1999|3p=15|4a1=Morris|4y=2008|4p=13|5a1=Johnson|5y=2008|5p=169|6a1=Franks|6y=2013|6pp=393–394}}{{refn|[[Herbert L. Osgood]] claimed that anarchism is &quot;the extreme antithesis&quot; of [[authoritarian communism]] and [[state socialism]].{{sfn|Osgood|1889|p=1}} [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]] states that &quot;[i]n general anarchism is closer to socialism than liberalism. ... Anarchism finds itself largely in the socialist camp, but it also has outriders in liberalism. It cannot be reduced to socialism, and is best seen as a separate and distinctive doctrine.&quot;{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} According to [[Jeremy Jennings]], &quot;[i]t is hard not to conclude that these ideas&quot;, referring to [[anarcho-capitalism]], &quot;are described as anarchist only on the basis of a misunderstanding of what anarchism is.&quot; Jennings adds that &quot;anarchism does not stand for the untrammelled freedom of the individual (as the 'anarcho-capitalists' appear to believe) but, as we have already seen, for the extension of individuality and community.&quot;{{sfn|Jennings|1999|p=147}} [[Nicolas Walter]] wrote that &quot;anarchism does derive from liberalism and socialism both historically and ideologically. ... In a sense, anarchists always remain liberals and socialists, and whenever they reject what is good in either they betray anarchism itself. ... We are liberals but more so, and socialists but more so.&quot;{{sfn|Walter|2002|p=44}} Michael Newman includes anarchism as one of many [[socialist traditions]], especially the more socialist-aligned tradition following Proudhon and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].{{sfn|Newman|2005|p=15}} [[Brian Morris (anthropologist)|Brian Morris]] argues that it is &quot;conceptually and historically misleading&quot; to &quot;create a dichotomy between socialism and anarchism.&quot;{{sfn|Morris|2015|p=64}}|group=nb}}

While [[opposition to the state]] is central to anarchist thought, defining ''anarchism'' is not an easy task for scholars, as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter, and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently.{{sfn|Long|2013|p=217}}{{refn|One common definition adopted by anarchists is that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing [[authority]] and [[hierarchical organisation]], including [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]], [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]], the [[State (polity)|state]], and all associated [[institution]]s, in the conduct of all [[human relations]] in favour of a society based on [[decentralisation]], [[freedom]], and [[voluntary association]]. Scholars highlight that this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on anti-authoritarianism (''[[a posteriori]]'' conclusion), anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that),{{sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1p=166|2a1=Jun|2y=2009|2p=507|3a1=Franks|3y=2013|3pp=386–388}} and etymology (negation of rulers).{{sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1pp=25–29|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2pp=217}}|group=nb}} Major definitional elements include the will for a non-coercive society, the rejection of the state apparatus, the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society, and a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|pp=25–26}}

== History ==
{{main|History of anarchism}}

=== Pre-modern era ===
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Napoli, 1969) - BEIC 6353768.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|[[Zeno of Citium]] (c. 334 – c. 262 BC), whose ''[[Republic (Zeno)|Republic]]'' inspired [[Peter Kropotkin]]{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=70}}]]
Before the establishment of towns and cities, an established authority did not exist. It was after the creation of institutions of authority that anarchistic ideas were espoused as a reaction.{{sfn|Graham|2005|pp=xi–xiv}} The most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in China and Greece. In China, [[philosophical anarchism]] (the discussion on the legitimacy of the state) was delineated by [[Taoist]] philosophers [[Zhuang Zhou]] and [[Laozi]].{{sfnm|1a1=Coutinho|1y=2016|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=54}} Alongside [[Stoicism]], Taoism has been said to have had &quot;significant anticipations&quot; of anarchism.{{Sfn|Sylvan|2007|p=257}}

Anarchic attitudes were also articulated by tragedians and philosophers in Greece. [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] used the myth of [[Antigone]] to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and personal [[autonomy]]. [[Socrates]] questioned Athenian authorities constantly and insisted on the right of individual freedom of conscience. [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] dismissed human law (''[[Nomos (sociology)|nomos]]'') and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (''[[physis]]''). [[Stoics]] were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4, 66–73}}

In [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements. These, and other Muslim movements, later gave birth to [[religious anarchism]]. In the [[Sasanian Empire]], [[Mazdak]] called for an [[egalitarian]] society and the [[abolition of monarchy]], only to be soon executed by Emperor [[Kavad I]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=86}}

In [[Basra]], religious sects preached against the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crone |first=Patricia |author-link=Patricia Crone |title=Ninth-Century Muslim Anarchists |journal=[[Past &amp; Present (journal)|Past &amp; Present]] |volume=167 |year=2000 |pages=3, 21–25&lt;!--3–28--&gt; |url=https://www.hs.ias.edu/files/Crone_Articles/Crone_Ninth_Century_Muslim_Anarchists.pdf |doi=10.1093/past/167.1.3 |access-date=3 January 2022 |archive-date=28 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200828210845/https://www.hs.ias.edu/files/Crone_Articles/Crone_Ninth_Century_Muslim_Anarchists.pdf |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, various sects developed anti-state and libertarian tendencies.{{sfn|Nettlau|1996|p=8}} Renewed interest in antiquity during the [[Renaissance]] and in private judgment during the [[Reformation]] restored elements of anti-authoritarian secularism, particularly in France.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=108}} [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] challenges to intellectual authority (secular and religious) and the [[List of revolutions and rebellions|revolutions of the 1790s and 1848]] all spurred the ideological development of what became the era of classical anarchism.{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=307}}

=== Modern era ===
During the [[French Revolution]], partisan groups such as the [[Enragés]] and the {{lang|fr|[[sans-culottes]]}} saw a turning point in the fermentation of anti-state and federalist sentiments.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=4}} The first anarchist currents developed throughout the 18th century as [[William Godwin]] espoused [[philosophical anarchism]] in England, morally delegitimising the state, [[Max Stirner]]'s thinking paved the way to [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s theory of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] found fertile soil in France.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}} By the late 1870s, various anarchist schools of thought had become well-defined and a wave of then unprecedented [[globalisation]] occurred from 1880 to 1914.{{sfn|Levy|2011|pp=10–15}} This era of [[classical anarchism]] lasted until the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and is considered the golden age of anarchism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4–5}}

[[File:Bakunin.png|thumb|upright|Mikhail Bakunin opposed the Marxist aim of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] and allied himself with the federalists in the First International before his expulsion by the Marxists.]]
Drawing from mutualism, [[Mikhail Bakunin]] founded [[collectivist anarchism]] and entered the [[International Workingmen's Association]], a class worker union later known as the First International that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents. The International became a significant political force, with [[Karl Marx]] being a leading figure and a member of its General Council. Bakunin's faction (the [[Jura Federation]]) and Proudhon's followers (the mutualists) opposed [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.{{sfnm|1a1=Dodson|1y=2002|1p=312|2a1=Thomas|2y=1985|2p=187|3a1=Chaliand|3a2=Blin|3y=2007|3p=116}} After bitter disputes, the Bakuninists were expelled from the International by the [[Marxists]] at the [[1872 Hague Congress]].{{sfnm|1a1=Graham|1y=2019|1pp=334–336|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=24}} Anarchists were treated similarly in the [[Second International]], being ultimately expelled in 1896.{{sfn|Levy|2011|p=12}} Bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by Marx's terms, they would end up the new tyrants of workers. In response to their expulsion from the First International, anarchists formed the [[St. Imier International]]. Under the influence of [[Peter Kropotkin]], a Russian philosopher and scientist, [[anarcho-communism]] overlapped with collectivism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=5}} Anarcho-communists, who drew inspiration from the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to one's needs.{{sfn|Graham|2005|p=xii}}

At the turn of the century, anarchism had spread all over the world.{{sfn|Moya|2015|p=327}} It was a notable feature of the international syndicalism movement.{{sfn|Levy|2011|p=16}} In China, small groups of students imported the humanistic pro-science version of anarcho-communism.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=519–521}} Tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east, travelling to the Japanese capital to study.{{sfnm|1a1=Dirlik|1y=1991|1p=133|2a1=Ramnath|2y=2019|2pp=681–682}} In Latin America, [[Anarchism in Argentina|Argentina]] was a stronghold for [[anarcho-syndicalism]], where it became the most prominent left-wing ideology.{{sfnm|1a1=Levy|1y=2011|1p=23|2a1=Laursen|2y=2019|2p=157|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3pp=504–508}} During this time, a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary [[political violence]]. This strategy became known as [[propaganda of the deed]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=633–636}} The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many [[Communards]] to penal colonies following the suppression of the Paris Commune favoured individualist political expression and acts.{{sfn|Anderson|2004}} Even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts, infamy came upon the movement and attempts were made to exclude them from American immigration, including the [[Immigration Act of 1903]], also called the Anarchist Exclusion Act.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1pp=633–636|2a1=Lutz|2a2=Ulmschneider|2y=2019|2p=46}} [[Illegalism]] was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period.{{sfn|Bantman|2019|p=374}}

[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|left|Nestor Makhno seen with members of the anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine]]]]
Despite concerns, anarchists enthusiastically participated in the [[Russian Revolution]] in opposition to the [[White movement]]; however, they met harsh suppression after the [[Bolshevik government]] was stabilised. Several anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine,{{sfn|Avrich|2006|p=204}} notably leading to the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] and the [[Makhnovshchina|Makhnovist movement]]. With the anarchists being crushed in Russia, two new antithetical currents emerged, namely [[platformism]] and [[synthesis anarchism]]. The former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party. Seeing the victories of the [[Bolsheviks]] in the [[October Revolution]] and the resulting [[Russian Civil War]], many workers and activists turned to [[communist parties]] which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, members of major syndicalist movements such as the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]] and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] left their organisations and joined the [[Communist International]].{{sfn|Nomad|1966|p=88}}

In the Spanish Civil War of 1936, anarchists and syndicalists ([[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]]) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists. A long tradition of [[Spanish anarchism]] led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war. In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain, where they [[collectivised]] the land.{{sfn|Bolloten|1984|p=1107}} The [[Soviet Union]] provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war, but the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists at a series of events named [[May Days]] as [[Joseph Stalin]] tried to seize control of the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi, 466}}

=== Post-war era ===
[[File:Rojava Sewing Cooperative.jpg|thumb|Rojava's support efforts for workers to form cooperatives is exemplified in this sewing cooperative.]]
By the end of [[World War II]], the anarchist movement had been severely weakened.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=xi}} The 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism, likely caused by a perceived failure of [[Marxism–Leninism]] and tensions built by the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=539}} During this time, anarchism found a presence in other movements critical towards both capitalism and the state such as the [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]], [[Environmental movement|environmental]], and [[peace movement]]s, the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], and the [[New Left]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=xi, 539}} It also saw a transition from its previous revolutionary nature to provocative [[anti-capitalist reform]]ism.{{sfn|Levy|2011|pp=5|p=}} Anarchism became associated with [[punk subculture]] as exemplified by bands such as [[Crass]] and the [[Sex Pistols]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=493–494}} The established [[feminist]] tendencies of [[anarcha-feminism]] returned with vigour during the [[second wave of feminism]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=556–557}} [[Black anarchism]] began to take form at this time and influenced anarchism's move from a [[Eurocentric]] demographic.{{sfn|Williams|2015|p=680}} This coincided with its failure to gain traction in Northern Europe and its unprecedented height in Latin America.{{sfn|Harmon|2011|p=70}}

Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence within [[anti-capitalist]], [[anti-war]] and [[anti-globalisation]] movements.{{sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[Group of Eight]] and the [[World Economic Forum]]. During the protests, ''ad hoc'' leaderless anonymous cadres known as [[black bloc]]s engaged in [[riot]]ing, [[property destruction]] and violent confrontations with the [[police]]. Other organisational tactics pioneered at this time include [[affinity group]]s, [[security culture]] and the use of decentralised technologies such as the Internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at the [[1999 Seattle WTO conference]].{{sfn|Rupert|2006|p=66}} Anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] in Mexico and the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, more commonly known as [[Rojava]], a ''de facto'' [[Permanent autonomous zone|autonomous region]] in northern Syria.{{sfn|Ramnath|2019|p=691}}

While having revolutionary aspirations, many forms of anarchism are not confrontational nowadays. Instead, they are trying to build an alternative way of social organization, based on mutual interdependence and voluntary cooperation. Scholar Carissa Honeywell takes the example of [[Food not Bombs]] group of collectives, to highlight some features of how anarchist groups work: direct action, working together and in solidarity with those left behind. While doing so, they inform about the rising rates of world hunger suggest a policies to tackle hunger, raging from de-funding the arms industry to addressing Monsanto seed-saving policies and patents, helping farmers and commodification of food and housing.{{sfn|Honeywell|2021|pp=34-44}} Honeywell also emphasizes that contemporary anarchists are interested in the flourishing not only of humans, but non-humans and the environment as well.{{sfn|Honeywell|2021|pp=1-2}} Honeywell argues that escalation of problems such as continuous wars and world poverty show that the current framework not only can not solve those pressing problems for humanity, but are causal factors as well, resulting in the rejection of representative democracy and the state as a whole.{{sfn|Honeywell|2021|pp=1-3}}

== Thought ==
{{main|Anarchist schools of thought}}
Anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions, [[social anarchism]] and [[individualist anarchism]], owing to their different origins, values and evolution.{{sfnm|1a1=McLean|1a2=McMillan|1y=2003|1loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;|2a1=Ostergaard|2y=2003|2p=14|2loc=&quot;Anarchism&quot;}} The individualist current emphasises [[negative liberty]] in opposing restraints upon the free individual, while the social current emphasises [[positive liberty]] in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and [[social ownership]].{{sfn|Harrison|Boyd|2003|p=251}} In a chronological sense, anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th century and the post-classical currents ([[anarcha-feminism]], [[green anarchism]], and [[post-anarchism]]) developed thereafter.{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=9}}

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies [[philosophical anarchism]] which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy, without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it.{{sfn|Egoumenides|2014|p=2}} A component especially of individualist anarchism,{{sfnm|1a1=Ostergaard|1y=2003|1p=12|2a1=Gabardi|2y=1986|2pp=300–302}} philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a [[minimal state]] but claims that citizens have no [[moral obligation]] to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy.{{sfn|Klosko|2005|p=4}} Anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since [[ethics]] have a central role in anarchist philosophy.{{sfn|Franks|2019|p=549}} Anarchism's emphasis on [[anti-capitalism]], [[egalitarianism]], and for the extension of community and individuality sets it apart from [[anarcho-capitalism]] and other types of [[economic libertarian]]ism.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1pp=564–565|2a1=Jennings|2y=1993|2p=143|3a1=Gay|3a2=Gay|3y=1999|3p=15|4a1=Morris|4y=2008|4p=13|5a1=Johnson|5y=2008|5p=169|6a1=Franks|6y=2013|6pp=393–394}}

Anarchism is usually placed on the [[far-left]] of the [[political spectrum]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brooks|1y=1994|1p=xi|2a1=Kahn|2y=2000|3a1=Moynihan|3y=2007}} Much of its [[Anarchist economics|economics]] and [[Anarchist law|legal philosophy]] reflect [[anti-authoritarian]], [[anti-statist]], [[libertarian]], and [[Radical politics|radical]] interpretations of [[left-wing]] and [[socialist]] politics{{sfn|Guérin|1970|p=12}} such as [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[Anarcho-communism|communism]], [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalism]], among other [[libertarian socialist]] economic theories.{{sfn|Guérin|1970|p=35|loc=&quot;Critique of authoritarian socialism&quot;}} As anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview,{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=14–17}} many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely.{{sfn|Sylvan|2007|p=262}} One reaction against [[sectarianism]] within the anarchist milieu was [[anarchism without adjectives]], a call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]] in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time.{{sfn|Avrich|1996|p=6}} Belief in political [[nihilism]] has been espoused by anarchists.{{sfn|Walter|2002|p=52}} Despite separation, the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but rather as tendencies that intermingle and are connected through a set of uniform principles such as individual and local autonomy, mutual aid, network organisation, communal democracy, justified authority and decentralisation.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1pp=1–6|2a1=Angelbeck|2a2=Grier|2y=2012|2p=551}}

=== Classical ===
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|Pierre-Joseph Proudhon is the primary proponent of mutualism and influenced many future individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers.{{sfn|Wilbur|2019|pp=216–218}}]]
Inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and [[Individualist anarchism|individualism]]. They were followed by the major currents of [[social anarchism]] ([[Collectivist anarchism|collectivist]], [[Anarcho-communism|communist]] and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|syndicalist]]). They differ on organisational and economic aspects of their ideal society.{{sfn|Levy|Adams|2018|p=2}}

Mutualism is an 18th-century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]. Its aims include [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], [[Free association (Marxism and anarchism)|free association]], voluntary [[contract]], [[federation]] and [[monetary reform]] of both credit and currency that would be regulated by a bank of the people.{{sfn|Wilbur|2019|pp=213–218}} Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.{{sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1y=1996|1p=6|2a1=Miller|2y=1991|2p=11}} In ''[[What Is Property?]]'' (1840), Proudhon first characterised his goal as a &quot;third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property.&quot;{{sfn|Pierson|2013|p=187}} Collectivist anarchism is a [[revolutionary socialist]] form of anarchism{{sfn|Morris|1993|p=76}} commonly associated with [[Mikhail Bakunin]].{{sfn|Shannon|2019|p=101}} Collectivist anarchists advocate [[collective ownership]] of the [[means of production]] which is theorised to be achieved through violent revolution{{sfn|Avrich|1996|pp=3–4}} and that workers be paid according to time worked, rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism. Collectivist anarchism arose alongside [[Marxism]] but rejected the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist [[stateless society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heywood|1y=2017|1pp=146–147|2a1=Bakunin|2y=1990}}

[[Anarcho-communism]] is a theory of anarchism that advocates a [[communist society]] with [[common ownership]] of the means of production,{{sfn|Mayne|1999|p=131}} [[direct democracy]] and a [[Horizontalidad|horizontal]] network of [[voluntary association]]s, [[workers' council]]s and [[worker cooperative]]s, with production and consumption based on the guiding principle &quot;[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]].&quot;{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=327|2a1=Turcato|2y=2019|2pp=237–323}} Anarcho-communism developed from radical socialist currents after the [[French Revolution]]{{sfn|Graham|2005}} but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the [[First International]].{{sfn|Pernicone|2009|pp=111–113}} It was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of [[Peter Kropotkin]],{{sfn|Turcato|2019|pp=239–244}} whose specific style would go onto become the dominating view of anarchists by the late 19th century.{{sfn|Levy|2011|p=6}} Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that views [[labour syndicate]]s as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are [[direct action]], workers' [[solidarity]] and [[workers' self-management]].{{sfn|Van der Walt|2019|p=249}}

Individualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the [[individual]] and their [[Will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants.{{sfn|Ryley|2019|p=225}} Early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include [[William Godwin]], [[Max Stirner]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Through many countries, individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of Bohemian artists and intellectuals{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=440}} as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as [[illegalism]] and [[individual reclamation]].{{sfnm|1a1=Imrie|1y=1994|2a1=Parry|2y=1987|2p=15}}

=== Post-classical and contemporary ===
{{main|Contemporary anarchism}}
[[File:Jarach and Zerzan.JPG|thumb|Lawrence Jarach (left) and [[John Zerzan]] (right) are two prominent contemporary anarchist authors, with Zerzan being a prominent voice within [[anarcho-primitivism]] and Jarach a notable advocate of [[post-left anarchy]].]]
Anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left. Interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the [[anti-globalisation movement]],{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=1}} whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=2}} As the movement shaped 21st century radicalism, wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest.{{sfn|Evren|2011|p=2}} Anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources and [[syncretic|combining disparate concepts]] to create new philosophical approaches.{{sfn|Williams|2007|p=303}} The [[anti-capitalist]] tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents.{{sfn|Williams|2018|p=4}}

Contemporary news coverage which emphasizes [[black bloc]] demonstrations has reinforced anarchism's historical association with chaos and violence. Its publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as [[anthropology]] and [[history]] to engage with the anarchist movement, although contemporary anarchism favours actions over academic theory.{{sfnm|1a1=Williams|1y=2010|1p=110|2a1=Evren|2y=2011|2p=1|3a1=Angelbeck|3a2=Grier|3y=2012|3p=549}} Various anarchist groups, tendencies, and schools of thought exist today, making it difficult to describe the contemporary anarchist movement.{{sfn|Franks|2013|pp=385–386}} While theorists and activists have established &quot;relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles&quot;, there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple ''anarchisms'', rather than a singular ''anarchism'', in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently. Gender equality can be a common principle, although it ranks as a higher priority to [[anarcha-feminists]] than [[anarcho-communists]].{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=386}}

Anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms, namely &quot;all centralized and hierarchical forms of government (e.g., monarchy, representative democracy, state socialism, etc.), economic class systems (e.g., capitalism, Bolshevism, feudalism, slavery, etc.), autocratic religions (e.g., fundamentalist Islam, Roman Catholicism, etc.), patriarchy, heterosexism, white supremacy, and imperialism.&quot;{{sfn|Jun|2009|pp=507–508}} Anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed.{{sfn|Jun|2009|p=507}} The principle of [[equal liberty]] is closer to anarchist political ethics in that it transcends both the liberal and socialist traditions. This entails that liberty and equality cannot be implemented within the state, resulting in the questioning of all forms of domination and hierarchy.{{sfn|Egoumenides|2014|p=91}}

== Tactics ==
Anarchists' tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals, namely to first oppose [[the Establishment]] and secondly to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society, illustrating the unity of means and ends.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=107–108}} A broad categorisation can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means on one hand and aims to change society through evolutionary means on the other.{{sfn|Williams|2018|pp=4–5}} Evolutionary tactics embrace [[nonviolence]], reject violence and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims, although there is significant overlap between the two.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|p=125}}

Anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century. Anarchists during the early 20th century focused more on strikes and militancy while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=112}}

=== Classical era ===
[[File:McKinleyAssassination.jpg|thumb|left|The relationship between [[anarchism and violence]] is a controversial subject among anarchists as shown by anarchist [[Leon Czolgosz]] [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassinating]] [[William McKinley]].]]
During the classical era, anarchists had a militant tendency. Not only did they confront state armed forces, as in Spain and Ukraine, but some of them also employed [[terrorism]] as [[propaganda of the deed]]. Assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state, some of which were successful. Anarchists also took part in [[revolution]]s.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=112–113}} Many anarchists, especially the [[Galleanists]], believed that these attempts would be the impetus for a revolution against capitalism and the state.{{sfn|Norris|2020|pp=7–8}} Many of these attacks were done by individual assailants and the majority took place in the late 1870s, the early 1880s and the 1890s, with some still occurring in the early 1900s.{{sfnm|1a1=Levy|1y=2011|1p=13|2a1=Nesser|2y=2012|2p=62}} Their decrease in prevalence was the result of further [[judicial]] power and targeting and cataloging by state institutions.{{sfn|Harmon|2011|p=55}}

Anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been controversial.{{sfn|Carter|1978|p=320}} [[Anarcho-pacifists]] advocate for non-violence means to achieve their stateless, nonviolent ends.{{sfn|Fiala|2017|loc=section 3.1}} Other anarchist groups advocate direct action, a tactic which can include acts of [[sabotage]] or terrorism. This attitude was quite prominent a century ago when seeing the state as a [[tyrant]] and some anarchists believing that they had every right to oppose its [[oppression]] by any means possible.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=116–117}} [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], who were proponents of limited use of violence, stated that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a [[necessary evil]].{{sfn|Carter|1978|pp=320–325}}

Anarchists took an active role in [[strike action]]s, although they tended to be antipathetic to formal [[syndicalism]], seeing it as [[reformist]]. They saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[capitalism]].{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=113}} Anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts, some of whom practiced [[naturism]] and [[nudism]]. Those anarchists also built communities which were based on [[friendship]] and were involved in the [[news media]].{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=114}}

=== Revolutionary ===
[[File:Black bloc at RNC running.jpg|thumb|Black bloc protesters parading anarcho-communism imagery such as the motto &quot;[[No War but the Class War]]&quot;]]
In the current era, Italian anarchist [[Alfredo Bonanno]], a proponent of [[insurrectionary anarchism]], has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late 19th century by Kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards. Both Bonanno and the French group [[The Invisible Committee]] advocate for small, informal affiliation groups, where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state, capitalism, and other enemies. Members of The Invisible Committee were arrested in 2008 on various charges, terrorism included.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=134–135}}

Overall, contemporary anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors. They mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots, especially in countries such as [[Anarchism in Canada|Canada]], [[Anarchism in Greece|Greece]], and [[Anarchism in Mexico|Mexico]]. Militant [[black bloc]] protest groups are known for clashing with the police;{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=115}} however, anarchists not only clash with state operators, they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists, taking [[anti-fascist]] action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=117}}

=== Evolutionary ===
Anarchists commonly employ [[direct action]]. This can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust [[hierarchy]], or the form of self-managing their lives through the creation of counter-institutions such as communes and non-hierarchical collectives.{{sfn|Williams|2018|pp=4–5}} Decision-making is often handled in an anti-authoritarian way, with everyone having equal say in each decision, an approach known as [[horizontalism]].{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109–117}} Contemporary-era anarchists have been engaging with various [[grassroots]] movements that are more or less based on horizontalism, although not explicitly anarchist, respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations. In contrast with the ''big-A anarchism'' of the classical era, the newly coined term ''small-a anarchism'' signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical-era anarchism or to refer to [[classical anarchists]] such as [[Peter Kropotkin]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] to justify their opinions. Those anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience which they will later theorize.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=145–149}}

The decision-making process of small anarchist [[affinity group]]s plays a significant tactical role.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109, 119}} Anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group without the need of a leader or a leading group. One way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point. Minorities usually accept rough consensus, except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist ethics, goals and values. Anarchists usually form small groups (5–20 individuals) to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members. These kinds of groups more often than not interconnect with each other, forming larger networks. Anarchists still support and participate in strikes, especially [[Wildcat strike action|wildcat strikes]] as these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=119–121}}

As in the past, newspapers and journals are used, and anarchists have gone [[online]] in the [[World Wide Web]] to spread their message. Anarchists have found it easier to create websites because of distributional and other difficulties, hosting electronic libraries and other portals.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=118–119}} Anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free. The way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals, especially when it comes to preserving users' privacy from state surveillance.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=120–121}}

Anarchists organize themselves to [[Squatting|squat]] and reclaim public spaces. During important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied, they are often called [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]s (TAZ), spaces where art, poetry, and [[surrealism]] are blended to display the anarchist ideal.{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1p=139|2a1=Mattern|2y=2019|2p=596|3a1=Williams|3y=2018|3pp=5–6}} As seen by anarchists, squatting is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market, serving pragmatical needs and also being an exemplary direct action.{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2012|1p=250|2a1=Williams|2y=2019|2p=119}} Acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=122}} Adding up these tactics while having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them, along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events, make up a [[carnivalesque]] atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity.{{sfn|Morland|2004|pp=37–38}}

&lt;!-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. --&gt;
As anarchism is a [[philosophy]] that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies, and schools of thought; disagreement over questions of values, ideology, and tactics is common. Its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created a number of [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]]. The compatibility of [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=565|2a1=Honderich|2y=1995|2p=31|3a1=Meltzer|3y=2000|3p=50|4a1=Goodway|4y=2006|4p=4|5a1=Newman|5y=2010|5p=53}} [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]], and [[Anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed, and anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and communism|communism]], [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivism]], [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], and [[trade unionism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[God|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[Veganarchism|veganism]], or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. Phenomena such as [[civilisation]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]]), and the [[Anarchism and statist democracy|democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.{{sfn|De George|2005|pp=31–32}}

=== Gender, sexuality, and free love ===
{{Main|Anarchism and issues related to love and sex}}
[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Émile Armand]] was a French individualist anarchist who propounded the virtues of free love in the Parisian anarchist milieu of the early 20th century]]
As gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy, many anarchists address, analyse, and oppose the suppression of one's autonomy imposed by gender roles.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|p=603}}

[[File:AnarchaFeminism.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Collection of [[anarcha-feminist]] protests, symbols, and flags]]
Sexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists but the few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=162}} Sexual violence was a concern for anarchists such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], who opposed age of consent laws, believing they would benefit predatory men.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=178}} A historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was [[free love]]. In contemporary anarchism, this current survives as a tendency to support [[polyamory]] and [[queer anarchism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Nicholas|1y=2019|1p=611|2a1=Jeppesen|2a2=Nazar|2y=2012|2pp=175–176}} Free love advocates were against marriage, which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women, largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men. The notion of free love was much broader and included a critique of the established order that limited women's sexual freedom and pleasure.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175–176}} Those free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses, where large groups of travelers, anarchists and other activists slept in beds together.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|p=177}} Free love had roots both in Europe and the United States; however, some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175–177}} Anarchist feminists were advocates of free love, against marriage, and pro-choice (utilising a contemporary term), and had a similar agenda. Anarchist and non-anarchist feminists differed on [[suffrage]] but were supportive of one another.{{sfn|Kinna2019|pp=166–167}}

During the second half of the 20th century, anarchism intermingled with the [[second wave of feminism]], radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well. By the latest decades of the 20th century, anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women, gays, queers and other marginalised groups, with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=609–611}} With the [[third wave of feminism]], sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists, yielding a [[post-structuralist]] critique of sexual normality.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=610–611}} Some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking, suggesting that it leaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=616–617}}

The interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism. Anarchists consider proper education, one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society, to be an act of [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1pp=83–85|2a2=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=514–515, 520}} Anarchist writers such as [[William Godwin]] (''[[Political Justice]]'') and [[Max Stirner]] (&quot;[[The False Principle of Our Education]]&quot;) attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges.{{sfnm|1a1=Suissa|1y=2019|1pp=514, 521|2a1=Kinna|2y=2019|2pp=83–86|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3p=222}}

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker [[Francisco Ferrer]] established the [[Escuela Moderna]] in Barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511–512}} Ferrer's approach was secular, rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process whilst giving pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance. Ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster [[class consciousness]] among students. The school closed after constant harassment by the state and Ferrer was later arrested. Nonetheless, his ideas formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|modern schools]] around the world.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511–514}} Christian anarchist [[Leo Tolstoy]], who published the essay ''Education and Culture'', also established a similar school with its founding principle being that &quot;for education to be effective it had to be free.&quot;{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=517–518}} In a similar token, A. S. Neill founded what became the [[Summerhill School]] in 1921, also declaring being free from coercion.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=518–519}}

Anarchist education is based largely on the idea that a child's right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality would lead children to morally good conclusions; however, there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation. Ferrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality, liberty and social justice were not possible under capitalism, along with other critiques of government and nationalism.{{sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1y=1980|1pp=3–33|2a1=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=519–522}}

Late 20th century and contemporary anarchist writers ([[Paul Goodman]], [[Herbert Read]], and [[Colin Ward]]) intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education, largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on children's creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in [[consumerism]] as part of a consumer society.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=89–96}} Contemporary anarchists such as Ward claim that state education serves to perpetuate socioeconomic inequality.{{sfn|Ward|1973|pp=39–48}}

While few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern-day, major tenets of anarchist schools, among them respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method, have spread among mainstream educational institutions. Judith Suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools, namely the Free Skool Santa Cruz in the United States which is part of a wider American-Canadian network of schools, the Self-Managed Learning College in Brighton, England, and the Paideia School in Spain.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=523–526}}

=== The state ===
&lt;!-- Important! Strive to explain how anarchists perceive authority and oppression and why they reject them. Jun (2019), p. 41. --&gt;
Objection to the [[State (polity)|state]] and its institutions is a ''[[sine qua non]]'' of anarchism.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=1971|1p=14|2a1=Jun|2y=2019|2pp=29–30}} Anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies. Instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life, major decisions are taken by a small elite. Authority ultimately rests solely on power, regardless of whether that power is [[Open government|open]] or [[Transparency (behavior)|transparent]], as it still has the ability to coerce people. Another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government, even the most altruistic among officials, will unavoidably seek to gain more power, leading to corruption. Anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the [[ruling class]] is distinct from the rest of society.{{sfn|Jun|2019|pp=32–38}}

Specific anarchist attitudes towards the state vary. [[Robert Paul Wolff]] believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate. Bakunin saw the state as meaning &quot;coercion, domination by means of coercion, camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be.&quot; [[A. John Simmons]] and [[Leslie Green (philosopher)|Leslie Green]], who leaned toward philosophical anarchism, believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus, although they saw this as highly unlikely.{{sfnm|1a1=Wendt|1y=2020|1p=2|2a1=Ashwood|2y=2018|2p=727}} Beliefs on how to abolish the state also differ.{{Sfn|Ashwood|2018|p=735}}

=== The arts ===
{{main|Anarchism and the arts}}
[[File:Apple Harvest by Camille Pissarro.jpg|thumb|340px|''Les chataigniers a Osny'' (1888) by anarchist painter Camille Pissarro is a notable example of blending anarchism and the arts.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=99}}]]
The connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism, especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists, surrealists and others.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|p=592}} In literature, anarchism was mostly associated with the [[New Apocalyptics]] and the [[neo-romanticism]] movement.{{snf|Gifford|2019|p=577}} In music, anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk.{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1pp=493–494|2a1=Dunn|2y=2012|3a1=Evren|3a2=Kinna|3a3=Rouselle|3y=2013|p=138}} Anarchists such as [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Herbert Read]] stated that the border between the artist and the non-artist, what separates art from a daily act, is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|pp=592–593}}

Other anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|p=593}} In his book ''Breaking the Spell: A History of Anarchist Filmmakers, Videotape Guerrillas, and Digital Ninjas'', Chris Robé claims that &quot;anarchist-inflected practices have increasingly structured movement-based video activism.&quot;{{sfn|Robé|2017|p=44}} Throughout the 20th century, many prominent anarchists ([[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Gustav Landauer]] and [[Camillo Berneri]]) and publications such as ''[[Anarchy (magazine)|Anarchy]]'' wrote about matters pertaining to the arts.{{sfn|Miller|Dirlik|Rosemont|Augustyn|2019|p=1}}

Three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists. It could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies, serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and even turn into a means of direct action such as in protests. As it appeals to both emotion and reason, art could appeal to the whole human and have a powerful effect.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|pp=593–596}} The 19th-century [[neo-impressionist]] movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=78}} In ''Les chataigniers a Osny'' by anarchist painter [[Camille Pissarro]], the blending of aesthetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=99}}

== Criticism ==
The most common critique of anarchism is that humans cannot [[Self-governance|self-govern]] and so a state is necessary for human survival. Philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] supported this critique, stating that &quot;[p]eace and war, tariffs, regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs, the preservation of a just system of distribution: these, among others, are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government.&quot;{{sfn|Krimerman|Perry|1966|p=494}} Another common criticism of anarchism is that it fits a world of isolation in which only the small enough entities can be self-governing; a response would be that major anarchist thinkers advocated [[anarchist federalism]].{{sfn|Ward|2004|p=78}}

Philosophy lecturer Andrew G. Fiala composed a list of common arguments against anarchism which includes critiques such as that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction, not only in the pragmatic world, such as at protests, but in the world of ethics as well. Secondly, anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state cannot be defeated practically. This line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it. The third argument is that anarchism is self-contradictory as a ruling theory that has no ruling theory. Anarchism also calls for collective action whilst endorsing the autonomy of the individual, hence no collective action can be taken. Lastly, Fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective (all talk and thoughts) and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong.{{sfn|Fiala|2017|loc=&quot;4. Objections and Replies&quot;}}

Philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of pro-anarchist books such as [[A. John Simmons]]' ''Moral Principles and Political Obligations''.{{sfn|Klosko|1999|p=536}} Law professor William A. Edmundson authored an essay to argue against three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious. Edmundson says that while the individual does not owe the state a duty of obedience, this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate.{{sfnm|1a1=Klosko|1y=1999|1p=536|2a1=Kristjánsson|2y=2000|2p=896}} In ''The Problem of Political Authority'', [[Michael Huemer]] defends philosophical anarchism,{{sfn|Dagger|2018|p=35}} claiming that &quot;political authority is a moral illusion.&quot;{{sfn|Rogers|2020|p=}}

One of the earliest criticisms is that anarchism defies and fails to understand the biological inclination to authority.{{sfn|Ferguson|1886}} [[Joseph Raz]] states that the acceptance of authority implies the belief that following their instructions will afford more success.{{sfn|Gans|1992|p=37}} Raz believes that this argument is true in following both authorities' successful and mistaken instruction.{{sfn|Gans|1992|p=38}} Anarchists reject this criticism because challenging or disobeying authority does not entail the disappearance of its advantages by acknowledging authority such as doctors or lawyers as reliable, nor does it involve a complete surrender of independent judgment.{{sfn|Gans|1992|pp=34, 38}} Anarchist perception of human nature, rejection of the state, and commitment to social revolution has been criticised by academics as naive, overly simplistic, and unrealistic, respectively.{{sfn|Brinn|2020|p=206}} Classical anarchism has been criticised for relying too heavily on the belief that the abolition of the state will lead to human cooperation prospering.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=162}}

[[Friedrich Engels]], considered to be one of the principal founders of [[Marxism]], criticised anarchism's anti-authoritarianism as inherently counter-revolutionary because in his view a revolution is by itself authoritarian.{{sfn|Tucker|1978}} Academic [[John Molyneux (academic)|John Molyneux]] writes in his book ''Anarchism: A Marxist Criticism'' that &quot;anarchism cannot win&quot;, believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas.{{sfn|Dodds|2011}} The Marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has a utopian character because all individuals should have anarchist views and values. According to the Marxist view, that a social idea would follow directly from this human ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence. Marxists state that this contradiction was responsible for their inability to act. In the anarchist vision, the conflict between liberty and equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining.{{sfn|Baár|Falina|Janowski|Kopeček|2016|p=488}}

[[File:Albedo-e hg.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The percentage of [[diffuse reflection|diffusely reflected]] [[sunlight]] relative to various surface conditions]]

'''Albedo''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|b|iː|d|oʊ}}; {{etymology|la|albedo|whiteness}}) is the measure of the [[diffuse reflection]] of [[sunlight|solar radiation]] out of the total [[solar radiation]] and measured on a scale from 0, corresponding to a [[black body]] that absorbs all incident radiation, to 1, corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation.

Surface albedo is defined as the ratio of [[Radiosity (radiometry)|radiosity]] ''J''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; to the [[irradiance]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; (flux per unit area) received by a surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parent.1/classes/782/Lectures/03_Radiometry.pdf |title=Fundamentals of Rendering - Radiometry / Photometry|author1=Pharr|author2=Humphreys|website=Web.cse.ohio-state.edu|access-date=2 March 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://curry.eas.gatech.edu/Courses/6140/ency/Chapter9/Ency_Atmos/Reflectance_Albedo_Surface.pdf |title=Reflectance and albedo, surface |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Atmosphere |editor=J. R. Holton |editor2=J. A. Curry |last=Coakley |first=J. A. |publisher=Academic Press |year=2003|pages=1914–1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location, and time (see [[position of the Sun]]). While bi-hemispherical [[reflectance]] is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the Sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly, or annual averages.

Unless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Henderson-Sellers |first1=A. |last2=Wilson |first2=M. F.|year=1983 |quote=Albedo observations of the Earth's surface for climate research |jstor=37357 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A |volume=309 |issue=1508 |title=The Study of the Ocean and the Land Surface from Satellites |pages=285–294 |bibcode=1983RSPTA.309..285H |doi=10.1098/rsta.1983.0042|s2cid=122094064 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface (between 0.3 and 3 μm). This spectrum includes [[visible spectrum|visible light]] (0.4–0.7 μm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation).

Albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]], [[astronomy]], and environmental management (e.g., as part of the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) program for sustainable rating of buildings). The average albedo of the Earth from the upper atmosphere, its ''planetary albedo'', is 30–35% because of [[cloud cover]], but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmental Encyclopedia |url=https://archive.org/details/environmentalenc01cunn |url-access=registration |edition=3rd |publisher=Thompson Gale |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7876-5486-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term albedo was introduced into optics by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in his 1760 work ''[[Photometria]]''.

Any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a [[black body]]. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhysicsWorld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html |title=Albedo – from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics |publisher=Scienceworld.wolfram.com |access-date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 0.3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goode&quot;/&gt; This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.

[[File:Ceres 2003 2004 clear sky total sky albedo.png|thumb|upright=1.2|left|2003–2004 mean annual clear-sky and total-sky albedo]]
Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]'s [[MODIS]] instruments on board the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites, and the CERES instrument on the [[Suomi NPP]] and [[Joint Polar Satellite System|JPSS]]. As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA&quot;/&gt;). These calculations are based on the [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF), which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. BDRF can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo.

Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the [[greenhouse effect]] is currently about {{convert|15|C|F}}. If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below {{convert|-40|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;washington&quot; /&gt; If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about {{convert|0|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;clim-past&quot;/&gt; In contrast, if the entire Earth was covered by water – a so-called [[ocean planet]] – the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost {{convert|27|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith Robin&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!--===Variability and recent/spatiotemporal changes===--&gt;
In 2021, scientists reported that Earth dimmed by ~0.5% over two decades (1998-2017) as measured by earthshine using modern photometric techniques. This may have both been co-caused by [[climate change]] as well as a substantial increase in global warming. However, the link to climate change has not been explored to date and it is unclear whether or not this represents an ongoing trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gray |first1=Jennifer |title=The Earth isn't as bright as it once was |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/04/weather/earth-dimming-climate/index.html |access-date=19 October 2021 |work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goode |first1=P. R. |last2=Pallé |first2=E. |last3=Shoumko |first3=A. |last4=Shoumko |first4=S. |last5=Montañes-Rodriguez |first5=P. |last6=Koonin |first6=S.

===White-sky, black-sky, and blue-sky albedo===
For land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular [[solar zenith angle]] ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms:
* the [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] at that solar zenith angle, &lt;math&gt;{\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo, and
* the [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]], &lt;math&gt;\bar{ \bar \alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes referred to as white-sky albedo.
with &lt;math&gt;{1-D}&lt;/math&gt; being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and &lt;math&gt;{D}&lt;/math&gt; being the proportion of diffuse illumination, the actual albedo &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; (also called blue-sky albedo) can then be given as:

:&lt;math&gt;{\alpha}= (1-D) \bar \alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar{ \bar \alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlueskyAlbedo&quot;/&gt;

==Examples of terrestrial albedo effects==

===Illumination===
Albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light, except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the Earth's surface at that location (e.g. through melting of reflective ice). That said, albedo and illumination both vary by latitude. Albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics, with a local maximum in the tropics.&lt;ref name=Winston&gt;{{cite journal| first=Jay |last=Winston |title=The Annual Course of Zonal Mean Albedo as Derived From ESSA 3 and 5 Digitized Picture Data |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=99 |pages=818–827| bibcode=1971MWRv...99..818W| date=1971| doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1971)099&lt;0818:TACOZM&gt;2.3.CO;2| issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insolation effects===
The intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local [[insolation]] (solar irradiance); high albedo areas in the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions are cold due to low insolation, whereas areas such as the [[Sahara Desert]], which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation. [[Tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] [[rainforest]] areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their [[temperate forest]] counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the [[Earth]]. This has been a concern since arctic ice and [[snow]] has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This [[Ice–albedo feedback|feedback loop]] results in a reduced albedo effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21721364-commercial-opportunities-are-vastly-outweighed-damage-climate-thawing-arctic|title=The thawing Arctic threatens an environmental catastrophe|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=8 May 2017|date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate and weather===
Albedo affects [[climate]] by determining how much [[radiation]] a planet absorbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=av7q4N8Ib6sC&amp;pg=PA53|title=Encyclopedia of Climate and Weather: Abs-Ero|last1=Schneider|first1=Stephen Henry|last2=Mastrandrea|first2=Michael D.|last3=Root|first3=Terry L.|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-976532-4|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land, ice, or ocean surfaces can drive [[weather]].

===Albedo–temperature feedback===
When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature [[feedback]] results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm [[air mass]]), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However, because local [[weather]] is dynamic due to the change of [[season]]s, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher [[insolation]]) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass, soil, or ocean, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.

===Snow===
Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Dorothy K. |author-link=Dorothy Hall (scientist)|title=Remote Sensing of Ice and Snow |date=1985 |publisher=Springer Netherlands |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-94-009-4842-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over [[Antarctica]] snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo [[positive feedback]]).

Just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow, the albedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water. Sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow. When sea ice melts, either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above, the snow-covered surface is reduced, and more surface of sea water is exposed, so the rate of energy absorption increases. The extra absorbed energy heats the sea water, which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts. As with the preceding example of snowmelt, the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;All About Sea Ice.&quot; National Snow and Ice Data Center. Accessed 16 November 2017. /cryosphere/seaice/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for [[global warming]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[Cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nat. Geo&quot;&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 &quot;Changing Greenland – Melt Zone&quot;] page 3, of 4, article by Mark Jenkins in ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' June 2010, accessed 8 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback, together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo, can lead to large errors in energy estimates. Because of this, in order to reduce the error of energy estimates, it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Small-scale effects===
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ranknfile-ue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&amp;s0897.html |title=Health and Safety: Be Cool!

=== Solar photovoltaic effects ===
Albedo can affect the [[electrical energy]] output of solar [[photovoltaic system|photovoltaic devices]]. For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10% for vertically (90°) mounted systems, but such effects were substantially lower for systems with lower surface tilts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andrews | first1 = Rob W. | last2 = Pearce | first2 = Joshua M. | date = 2013 | title = The effect of spectral albedo on amorphous silicon and crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic device performance | journal = Solar Energy | volume = 91 | pages = 233–241 | doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2013.01.030 |bibcode = 2013SoEn...91..233A | url = https://www.academia.edu/3081684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectral albedo strongly affects the performance of [[bifacial solar cells]] where rear surface performance gains of over 20% have been observed for c-Si cells installed above healthy vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Riedel-Lyngskær | first1 = Nicholas| last2 = Ribaconka | first2 = Ribaconka | last3 = Po | first3 = Mario | last4 = Thorseth | first4 = Anders | last5 = Thorsteinsson | first5 = Sune | last6 = Dam-Hansen | first6 = Carsten | last7 = Jakobsen | first7 = Michael L. | date = 2022| title = The effect of spectral albedo in bifacial photovoltaic performance | journal = Solar Energy | volume = 231| pages = 921–935 | doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2021.12.023 | url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X21010720 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis on the bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) provided effective albedo values for simulating the performance of seven photovoltaic materials mounted on three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brennan | first1 = M.P. | author-link4 = J.

===Trees===
Because forests generally have a low albedo, (the majority of the ultraviolet and [[visible spectrum]] is absorbed through [[photosynthesis]]), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of [[afforestation]] (or offset the negative climate impacts of [[deforestation]]). In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Betts&quot; /&gt; Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through [[evapotranspiration]]. The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boucher | date = 2004 | title = Direct human influence of irrigation on atmospheric water vapour and climate | journal = Climate Dynamics | volume = 22 | issue = 6–7| pages = 597–603 | doi=10.1007/s00382-004-0402-4|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2004ClDy...22..597B | s2cid = 129640195 | url = https://www.academia.edu/25329256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonan | first1 = GB | date = 2008 | title = Forests and Climate Change: Forcings, Feedbacks, and the Climate Benefits of Forests | journal = Science | volume = 320 | issue = 5882| pages = 1444–1449 | doi = 10.1126/science.1155121 | pmid=18556546|bibcode = 2008Sci...320.1444B  | s2cid = 45466312 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1230896 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. [[Deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmutrees&quot; /&gt; Variation in summer albedo across both forest types is associated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ollinger&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Betts&quot; /&gt;

===Water===
[[File:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Reflectivity of smooth water at {{convert|20|C|F}} (refractive index=1.333)]]
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]].

At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence (optics)|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fresnel&quot; /&gt;

Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.

Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh 'black' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.
Snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0.9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2007-01-31 |title=Arctic Reflection: Clouds Replace Snow and Ice as Solar Reflector |url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/ArcticReflector/arctic_reflector4.php |access-date=2022-04-28 |website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clouds===
[[Cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. &quot;On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;livescience&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html |title=Baffled Scientists Say Less Sunlight Reaching Earth |publisher=LiveScience |date=24 January 2006 |access-date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contrails reduce daily temperature range|url=http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|journal=Nature |access-date=7 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503192714/http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|archive-date=3 May 2006|page=601|volume=418|issue=6898|date=8 August 2002|url-status=dead|doi=10.1038/418601a|bibcode = 2002Natur.418..601T|pmid=12167846|last1=Travis|first1=D.

===Aerosol effects===
[[Aerosols]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth's radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671 |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |access-date=19 August 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175429/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm| archive-date= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per Spracklen et al.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOMINICK&quot; /&gt; the effects are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- Aerosol radiative forcing. --&gt;
* ''Aerosol direct effect.'' Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.
* ''Aerosol indirect effect.'' Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (''first indirect effect''), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (''second indirect effect'').
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In extremely polluted cities like [[Delhi]], aerosol pollutants influence local weather and induce an [[Urban heat island#Urban cold island|urban cool island]] effect during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Masson|first1=Valéry|last2=Lemonsu|first2=Aude|last3=Hidalgo|first3=Julia|last4=Voogt|first4=James|date=2020-10-17|title=Urban Climates and Climate Change|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|language=en|volume=45|issue=1|pages=411–444|doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-012320-083623|doi-access=free|issn=1543-5938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black carbon===
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from [[black carbon]] particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] estimates that the global mean [[radiative forcing]] for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |access-date=19 August 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180154/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm| archive-date= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.&lt;ref&gt;James Hansen &amp; Larissa Nazarenko, ''Soot Climate Forcing Via Snow and Ice Albedos'', 101 Proc. of the Nat'l.

== Astronomical albedo ==
In astronomy, the term '''albedo''' can be defined in several different ways, depending upon the application and the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation involved. 

===Optical or visual albedo===
The albedos of [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|satellites]] and [[minor planet]]s such as [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (&quot;phase angle&quot;), and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer [[Solar System]] objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in [[asteroid]]s.

[[Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known optical albedos of any body in the Solar System, with an albedo of 0.99. Another notable high-albedo body is [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], with an albedo of 0.96.&lt;ref name=&quot;sicardy&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; but it is strongly directional and non-[[Lambertian reflectance|Lambertian]], displaying also a strong [[opposition effect]].&lt;ref name=&quot;medkeff&quot; /&gt; Although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the [[regolith]] surfaces of airless Solar System bodies.

Two common optical albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) [[geometric albedo]] (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the [[Bond albedo]] (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.

In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five [[Hapke parameters]] which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], including a characterization of the opposition effect of [[regolith]] surfaces. One of these five parameters is yet another type of albedo called the [[single-scattering albedo]]. It is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material ([[refractive index]]), the size of the particle, and the wavelength of the incoming radiation. 

An important relationship between an object's astronomical (geometric) albedo, [[Absolute magnitude#Absolute magnitude for planets (H)|absolute magnitude]] and diameter is given by:&lt;ref name=&quot;bruton&quot;&gt;{{cite web

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the astronomical albedo, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter in kilometers, and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute magnitude.

===Radar albedo===
In planetary [[radar astronomy]], a microwave (or radar) pulse is transmitted toward a planetary target (e.g. Moon, asteroid, etc.) and the echo from the target is measured. In most instances, the transmitted pulse is [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] and the received pulse is measured in the same sense of polarization as the transmitted pulse (SC) and the opposite sense (OC).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostro_Planetary_Radar&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ostro |first1=S.

P. |title=Asteroid Radar Astronomy in Asteroids III |date=2002 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |isbn=9780816522811 |pages=151–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The echo power is measured in terms of [[radar cross-section]], &lt;math&gt;{\sigma}_{OC}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\sigma}_{SC}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;{\sigma}_{T}&lt;/math&gt; (total power, SC + OC) and is equal to the cross-sectional area of a metallic sphere (perfect reflector) at the same distance as the target that would return the same echo power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostro_Planetary_Radar&quot; /&gt;

Those components of the received echo that return from first-surface reflections (as from a smooth or mirror-like surface) are dominated by the OC component as there is a reversal in polarization upon reflection. If the surface is rough at the wavelength scale or there is significant penetration into the regolith, there will be a significant SC component in the echo caused by multiple scattering.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostro_Asteroid_Radar&quot; /&gt;

For most objects in the solar system, the OC echo dominates and the most commonly reported radar albedo parameter is the (normalized) OC radar albedo (often shortened to radar albedo):&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostro_Planetary_Radar&quot; /&gt;

&lt;math display=&quot;block&quot;&gt; \hat{\sigma}_{OC} =\left ( \frac{{\sigma}_{OC}}{\pi r^2} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

where the denominator is the effective cross-sectional area of the target object with mean radius, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. A smooth metallic sphere would have &lt;math&gt;\hat{\sigma}_{OC} = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

The values reported for the Moon, Mercury, Mars, Venus, and Comet P/2005 JQ5 are derived from the total (OC+SC) radar albedo reported in those references.

====Relationship to surface [[bulk density]]====
In the event that most of the echo is from first surface reflections (&lt;math&gt;\hat{\sigma}_{OC}&lt;0.1&lt;/math&gt; or so), the OC radar albedo is a first-order approximation of the Fresnel reflection coefficient (aka reflectivity)&lt;ref name=&quot;Ostro_Asteroid_Radar&quot; /&gt; and can be used to estimate the bulk density of a planetary surface to a depth of a meter or so (a few wavelengths of the radar wavelength which is typically at the decimeter scale) using the following empirical relationships:&lt;ref name=&quot;Shepard_M2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shepard |first1=M.

The '''aardvark''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑːr|d|v|ɑːr|k|}} {{respell|ARD|vark}}; '''''Orycteropus afer''''') is a medium-sized, burrowing, [[nocturnal]] [[mammal]] native to Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dsae.co.za/entry/aardvark/e00015 &quot;Aardvark, n.&quot;] ''Dictionary of South African English''. Dictionary Unit for South African English, 2018. 26 February 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only living [[species]] of the order [[Tubulidentata]],&lt;ref name=&quot;MSW3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Schlitter|2005|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EoM&quot; /&gt; although other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known. Unlike most other [[insectivore]]s, it has a long [[pig]]-like snout, which is used to sniff out food.

It roams over most of the southern two-thirds of the African continent, avoiding areas that are mainly rocky. A nocturnal feeder, it subsists on ants and termites, which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs. It also digs to create burrows in which to live and rear its young. The animal is listed as &quot;least concern&quot; by the [[IUCN]], although its numbers are decreasing. Aardvarks are [[afrothere]]s, a [[clade]] which also includes [[elephants]], [[manatees]], and [[hyraxes]].

==Name and taxonomy==

=== Name ===
The aardvark is sometimes colloquially called the &quot;African ant bear&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Colliers&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Goodwin|1997|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;anteater&quot; (not to be confused with the [[anteater|South American anteater]]), or the &quot;Cape anteater&quot;&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; after the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. The name &quot;aardvark&quot; is [[Afrikaans]] ({{IPA-af|ˈɑːrtfark}}), comes from earlier Afrikaans ''erdvark''&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; and means &quot;earth [[pig]]&quot; or &quot;ground pig&quot; (''aarde'': &quot;earth/ground&quot;, ''vark'': &quot;pig&quot;), because of its burrowing habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;aardvark, n.&quot; ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, March 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/22. Accessed 24 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dsae.co.za/entry/aardvark/e00015 &quot;Aardvark, n.&quot;] ''Dictionary of South African English''. Dictionary Unit for South African English, 2018. 25 February 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Orycteropus'' means &quot;burrowing foot&quot;, and the name ''afer'' refers to Africa.&lt;ref name=sho/&gt; The name of the aardvark's order, ''Tubulidentata,'' comes from the tubule-style teeth.&lt;ref name=sho1&gt;{{harvnb|Shoshani|2002|p=619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taxonomy ===
[[File:Aardvark skull.JPG|thumb|Skull of an aardvark]]
The aardvark is not closely related to the pig; rather, it is the sole extant representative of the obscure mammalian [[order (biology)|order]] [[Tubulidentata]],&lt;ref name=sho&gt;{{harvnb|Shoshani|2002|p=618}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which it is usually considered to form one variable species of the genus ''[[Orycteropus]]'', the sole surviving genus in the family [[Orycteropodidae]]. The aardvark is not closely related to the [[South America]]n [[anteater]], despite sharing some characteristics and a superficial resemblance.&lt;ref name=awf/&gt; The similarities are based on [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt; The closest living relatives of the aardvark are the [[elephant shrew]]s, [[tenrecidae|tenrec]]s and [[golden mole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Asher|Bennett|Lehmann|2009|p=854}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the [[sirenian]]s, [[hyrax]]es, [[elephant]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rodriguez|2013|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their extinct relatives, these animals form the superorder [[Afrotheria]].&lt;ref name=UR&gt;{{harvnb|Rahm|1990|pp=450–451}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of the brain have shown the similarities with [[Condylarthra]],&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt; and given the clade's status as a [[wastebasket taxon]] it may mean some species traditionally classified as &quot;condylarths&quot; are actually stem-aardvarks.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

=== Evolutionary history ===
Based on fossils, [[Bryan Patterson]] has concluded that early relatives of the aardvark appeared in [[Africa]] around the end of the [[Paleocene]].&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt;&lt;ref name=sho2&gt;{{harvnb|Shoshani|2002|p=620}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ptolemaiida]]ns, a mysterious clade of mammals with uncertain affinities, may actually be stem-aardvarks, either as a sister clade to [[Tubulidentata]] or as a grade leading to true tubulidentates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cote et al 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cote S, Werdelin L, Seiffert ER, Barry JC |title=Additional material of the enigmatic Early Miocene mammal ''Kelba'' and its relationship to the order Ptolemaiida |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=104 |issue=13 |pages=5510–5 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17372202 |pmc=1838468 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0700441104 |bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.5510C |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seifert2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seiffert|first=Erik R|title=A new estimate of afrotherian phylogeny based on simultaneous analysis of genomic, morphological, and fossil evidence|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|year=2007|volume=7|issue=1|pages=224|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-7-224|url= |pmid=17999766|pmc=2248600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first unambiguous tubulidentate was probably ''[[Myorycteropus africanus]]'' from [[Kenya]]n [[Miocene]] deposits.&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt; The earliest example from the genus ''[[Orycteropus]]'' was ''[[Orycteropus mauritanicus]]'', found in [[Algeria]] in deposits from the middle Miocene, with an equally old version found in Kenya.&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt; Fossils from the aardvark have been dated to 5 million years, and have been located throughout [[Europe]] and the [[Near East]].&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt;

The mysterious Pleistocene ''[[Plesiorycteropus]]'' from [[Madagascar]] was originally thought to be a tubulidentate that was descended from ancestors that entered the island during the [[Eocene]]. However, a number of subtle anatomical differences coupled with recent molecular evidence now lead researchers to believe that ''Plesiorycteropus'' is a relative of golden moles and tenrecs that achieved an aardvark-like appearance and ecological niche through convergent evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0059614|title=A Molecular Phylogeny of Plesiorycteropus Reassigns the Extinct Mammalian Order 'Bibymalagasia'|year=2013|last1=Buckley|first1=Michael|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=3|pages=e59614|pmid=23555726|pmc=3608660|bibcode=2013PLoSO...859614B|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Aardvark skeleton mount.JPG|thumb|right|An aardvark skeleton and mounted individual]]
The aardvark is vaguely pig-like in appearance. Its body is stout with a prominently arched back&lt;ref name=UR1&gt;{{harvnb|Rahm|1990|p=452}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs. The limbs are of moderate length, with the rear legs being longer than the forelegs.&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; The front feet have lost the pollex (or 'thumb'), resulting in four toes, while the rear feet have all five toes. Each toe bears a large, robust [[Nail (anatomy)|nail]] which is somewhat flattened and shovel-like, and appears to be intermediate between a [[claw]] and a hoof. Whereas the aardvark is considered [[digitigrade]], it appears at times to be [[plantigrade]]. This confusion happens because when it squats it stands on its soles.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; A contributing characteristic to the burrow digging capabilities of aardvarks is an endosteal tissue called compacted coarse cancellous bone (CCCB). The stress and strain resistance provided by CCCB allows aardvarks to create their burrows, ultimately leading to a favorable environment for plants and a variety of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Legendre |first1=Lucas J. |last2=Botha-Brink |first2=Jennifer |title=Digging the compromise: investigating the link between limb bone histology and fossoriality in the aardvark (Orycteropus afer) |journal=PeerJ |date=11 July 2018 |volume=6 |pages=e5216 |doi=10.7717/peerj.5216 |pmid=30018860 |pmc=6045922 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haussmann |first1=Natalie S. |last2=Louw |first2=Michelle A. |last3=Lewis |first3=Simone |last4=Nicol |first4=Keegan J. H. |last5=van der Merwe |first5=Stephni |last6=le Roux |first6=Peter C. |title=Ecosystem engineering through aardvark (Orycteropus afer) burrowing: Mechanisms and effects |journal=Ecological Engineering |date=1 August 2018 |volume=118 |pages=66–72 |doi=10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.04.022 |hdl=2263/65084 |s2cid=104179393 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An aardvark's weight is typically between {{convert|60|and(-)|80|kg}}.&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; An aardvark's length is usually between {{convert|105|and(-)|130|cm|ft}},&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; and can reach lengths of {{convert|2.2|m}} when its tail (which can be up to {{convert|70|cm}}) is taken into account. It is {{convert|60|cm|in}} tall at the shoulder, and has a girth of about {{convert|100|cm|ft}}.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; It is the [[Largest organisms|largest]] member of the proposed clade [[Afroinsectiphilia]]. The aardvark is pale yellowish-gray in color and often stained reddish-brown by [[soil]]. The aardvark's coat is thin, and the animal's primary protection is its tough skin. Its hair is short on its head and tail; however its legs tend to have longer hair.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; The hair on the majority of its body is grouped in clusters of 3-4 hairs.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; The hair surrounding its nostrils is dense to help filter particulate matter out as it digs. Its tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers.

===Head===
The greatly elongated head is set on a short, thick neck, and the end of the snout bears a disc, which houses the nostrils. It contains a thin but complete [[zygomatic arch]].&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; The head of the aardvark contains many unique and different features. One of the most distinctive characteristics of the Tubulidentata is their [[Tooth|teeth]]. Instead of having a [[pulp (tooth)|pulp cavity]], each tooth has a cluster of thin, hexagonal, upright, parallel tubes of vasodentin (a modified form of [[dentine]]), with individual pulp canals, held together by [[cementum]].&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; The number of columns is dependent on the size of the tooth, with the largest having about 1,500.&lt;ref name=UR2/&gt; The teeth have no [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] coating and are worn away and regrow continuously.&lt;ref name=sho1/&gt; The aardvark is born with conventional incisors and [[canine tooth|canines]] at the front of the jaw, which fall out and are not replaced. Adult aardvarks have only cheek teeth at the back of the [[jaw]], and have a [[dentition|dental formula]] of: {{DentalFormula|upper=0.0.2-3.3|lower=0.0.2.3}} These remaining teeth are peg-like and rootless and are of unique composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|1983|p=377}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teeth consist of 14 upper and 12 lower jaw molars.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; The nasal area of the aardvark is another unique area, as it contains ten [[nasal concha]]e, more than any other placental mammal.&lt;ref name=UR/&gt;

The sides of the nostrils are thick with hair.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; The tip of the snout is highly mobile and is moved by modified [[mimetic muscles]].&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; The fleshy dividing tissue between its nostrils probably has sensory functions,&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; but it is uncertain whether they are olfactory or vibratory in nature.&lt;ref name=UR6&gt;{{harvnb|Rahm|1990|p=458}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its nose is made up of more [[turbinate]] bones than any other mammal, with between 9 and 11, compared to dogs with 4 to 5.&lt;ref name=sho1/&gt; With a large quantity of turbinate bones, the aardvark has more space for the moist [[epithelium]], which is the location of the olfactory bulb.&lt;ref name=sho1/&gt; The nose contains nine [[olfactory bulb]]s, more than any other mammal.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; Its keen sense of smell is not just from the quantity of bulbs in the nose but also in the development of the brain, as its [[Olfactory bulb|olfactory lobe]] is very developed.&lt;ref name=UR2&gt;{{harvnb|Rahm|1990|pp=453–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; The snout resembles an elongated pig snout. The mouth is small and tubular, typical of species that feed on [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s. The aardvark has a long, thin, snakelike, protruding tongue (as much as {{convert|30|cm|in}} long)&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; and elaborate structures supporting a keen [[olfaction|sense of smell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TaylorSkinner&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|Skinner|2004|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ears, which are very effective,&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; are disproportionately long, about {{convert|20|-|25|cm|in}} long.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; The eyes are small for its head, and consist only of [[rod cell|rods]].&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt;

===Digestive system===
The aardvark's stomach has a muscular [[pyloric]] area that acts as a [[gizzard]] to grind swallowed food up, thereby rendering chewing unnecessary.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; Its [[cecum]] is large.&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; Both sexes emit a strong smelling secretion from an anal gland.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; Its [[salivary gland]]s are highly developed and almost completely ring the neck;&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; their output is what causes the tongue to maintain its tackiness.&lt;ref name=UR1/&gt; The female has two pairs of [[teat]]s in the inguinal region.&lt;ref name=UR/&gt;

[[Gene]]tically speaking, the aardvark is a [[living fossil]], as its [[chromosome]]s are highly conserved, reflecting much of the early [[eutherian]] arrangement before the divergence of the major modern [[taxon|taxa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat and range==
Aardvarks are found in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], where suitable [[habitat]] ([[savanna]]s, [[grassland]]s, [[woodland]]s and [[bushland]]) and food (i.e., [[ants]] and [[termites]]) is available.&lt;ref name=&quot;awf&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|African Wildlife Foundation|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They spend the daylight hours in dark burrows to avoid the heat of the day.&lt;ref name=ez&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only major habitat that they are not present in is swamp forest, as the high water table precludes digging to a sufficient depth.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn status 12 November 2021&quot; /&gt; They also avoid terrain rocky enough to cause problems with digging.&lt;ref name=UR3&gt;{{harvnb|Rahm|1990|p=455}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been documented as high as {{convert|3200|m|ft}} in Ethiopia. They are present throughout sub-Saharan Africa all the way to South Africa with few exceptions including the coastal areas of [[Namibia]], [[Ivory Coast]], and [[Ghana]]. They are not found in Madagascar.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn status 12 November 2021&quot; /&gt;

==Ecology and behaviour==
[[File:Orycteropus afer.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Aardvark resting]]
[[File:Erdvarkgat, Dingaanstat.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to a burrow]]
[[File:SanWild17.jpg|thumb|right|Emerging from a burrow]]
Aardvarks live for up to 23&amp;nbsp;years in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]].&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; Its keen hearing warns it of predators: [[lion]]s, [[leopard]]s, cheetahs, [[African wild dog]]s, [[hyena]]s, and [[pythonidae|pythons]].&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt;&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; Some humans also hunt aardvarks for meat.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; Aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemies, but if all else fails, they will strike with their claws, tail and shoulders, sometimes flipping onto their backs lying motionless except to lash out with all four feet.&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; They are capable of causing substantial damage to unprotected areas of an attacker.&lt;ref name=sho1/&gt; They will also dig to escape as they can. Sometimes, when pressed, aardvarks can dig extremely quickly.
&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt;

===Feeding===
The aardvark is [[nocturnal]] and is a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s ([[myrmecophagy]]);&lt;ref name=&quot;EoM&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|van Aarde|1984|pp=466–467}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the [[aardvark cucumber]].&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; In fact, the cucumber and the aardvark have a symbiotic relationship as they eat the subterranean fruit, then defecate the seeds near their burrows, which then grow rapidly due to the loose soil and fertile nature of the area. The time spent in the intestine of the aardvark helps the fertility of the seed, and the fruit provides needed moisture for the aardvark.&lt;ref name=sho1/&gt;&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; They avoid eating the African [[driver ant]] and red ants.&lt;ref name=UR4/&gt; Due to their stringent diet requirements, they require a large range to survive.&lt;ref name=UR3/&gt; An aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset, and forages over a considerable home range encompassing {{convert|10|to|30|km|mi}}. While foraging for food, the aardvark will keep its nose to the ground and its ears pointed forward, which indicates that both smell and hearing are involved in the search for food. They zig-zag as they forage and will usually not repeat a route for 5–8 days as they appear to allow time for the termite nests to recover before feeding on it again.&lt;ref name=UR4/&gt;

During a foraging period, they will stop to dig a &quot;V&quot; shaped trench with their forefeet and then sniff it profusely as a means to explore their location.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; When a concentration of ants or termites is detected, the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs, keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators, and takes up an astonishing number of [[insect]]s with its long, sticky tongue—as many as 50,000 in one night have been recorded. Its claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of a termite or ant mound quickly. It avoids inhaling the dust by sealing the nostrils.&lt;ref name=ez/&gt; When successful, the aardvark's long (up to {{convert|30|cm|in}})&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; tongue licks up the insects; the termites' biting, or the ants' stinging attacks are rendered futile by the tough skin. After an aardvark visit at a termite mound, other animals will visit to pick up all the leftovers.&lt;ref name=UR5&gt;{{harvnb|Rahm|1990|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Termite mounds alone do not provide enough food for the aardvark, so they look for termites that are on the move. When these insects move, they can form columns {{convert|10|-|40|m|ft}} long and these tend to provide easy pickings with little effort exerted by the aardvark. These columns are more common in areas of livestock or other hoofed animals.&lt;ref name=UR5/&gt; The trampled grass and dung attract termites from the ''[[Odontotermes]]'', ''[[Microtermes]]'', and ''[[Pseudacanthotermes]]'' genera.&lt;ref name=UR5/&gt;

On a nightly basis they tend to be more active during the first portion of night (roughly the four hours between 8:00{{nbsp}}p.m. and 12:00{{nbsp}}a.m.); however, they don't seem to prefer bright or dark nights over the other. During adverse weather or if disturbed they will retreat to their burrow systems. They cover between {{convert|2|and|5|km|mi}} per night; however, some studies have shown that they may traverse as far as {{convert|30|km|mi}} in a night.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt;

===Vocalization===
The aardvark is a rather quiet animal. However, it does make soft grunting sounds as it forages and loud grunts as it makes for its tunnel entrance.&lt;ref name=UR3/&gt; It makes a bleating sound if frightened.&lt;ref name=UR4&gt;{{harvnb|Rahm|1990|p=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it is threatened it will make for one of its burrows. If one is not close it will dig a new one rapidly. This new one will be short and require the aardvark to back out when the coast is clear.&lt;ref name=UR4/&gt;

===Movement===
The aardvark is known to be a good swimmer and has been witnessed successfully swimming in strong currents.&lt;ref name=UR4/&gt; It can dig a yard of tunnel in about five minutes,&lt;ref name=UR3/&gt; but otherwise moves fairly slowly.

When leaving the burrow at night, they pause at the entrance for about ten minutes, sniffing and listening. After this period of watchfulness, it will bound out and within seconds it will be {{convert|10|m|ft}} away. It will then pause, prick its ears, twisting its head to listen, then jump and move off to start foraging.&lt;ref name=UR3/&gt;

Aside from digging out ants and termites, the aardvark also [[fossorial|excavates]] burrows in which to live, which generally fall into one of three categories: burrows made while foraging, refuge and resting location, and permanent homes.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; Temporary sites are scattered around the home range and are used as refuges, while the main [[burrow]] is also used for breeding. Main burrows can be deep and extensive, have several entrances and can be as long as {{convert|13|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; These burrows can be large enough for a person to enter.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; The aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly, and periodically moves on and makes a new one. The old burrows are an important part of the African wildlife scene. As they are vacated, then they are inhabited by smaller animals like the [[African Wild Dog|African wild dog]], [[ant-eating chat]], ''[[Nycteris thebaica]]'' and [[warthog]]s.&lt;ref name=UR4/&gt; Other animals that use them are hares, mongooses, hyenas, owls, pythons, and lizards. Without these refuges many animals would die during wildfire season.&lt;ref name=UR4/&gt; Only mothers and young share burrows; however, the aardvark is known to live in small family groups or as a solitary creature.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; If attacked in the tunnel, it will escape by digging out of the tunnel thereby placing the fresh fill between it and its predator, or if it decides to fight it will roll onto its back, and attack with its claws.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; The aardvark has been known to sleep in a recently excavated [[ant]] nest, which also serves as protection from its [[predator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
[[File:Aardvarks.jpg|thumb|right|Aardvark mother and young]]
Aardvarks pair only during the breeding season; after a [[gestation]] period of seven months,&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; one cub weighing around {{convert|1.7|-|1.9|kg|lb}}&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; is born during May–July.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; When born, the young has flaccid ears and many wrinkles. When nursing, it will nurse off each teat in succession.&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; After two weeks, the folds of skin disappear and after three, the ears can be held upright.&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; After 5–6 weeks, body hair starts growing.&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; It is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks and eats termites at 9&amp;nbsp;weeks,&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt; and is weaned between three months&lt;ref name=UR/&gt; and 16&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; At six months of age, it is able to dig its own burrows, but it will often remain with the mother until the next [[mating season]],&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; and is sexually mature from approximately two years of age.&lt;ref name=UR/&gt;

==Conservation==
Aardvarks were thought to have declining numbers,&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; however, this is possibly because they are not readily seen.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn status 12 November 2021&quot; /&gt; There are no definitive counts because of their nocturnal and secretive habits; however, their numbers seem to be stable overall. They are not considered common anywhere in Africa, but due to their large range, they maintain sufficient numbers. There may be a slight decrease in numbers in eastern, northern, and western Africa. Southern African numbers are not decreasing. It receives an official designation from the IUCN as [[least concern]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn status 12 November 2021&quot; /&gt; However, they are a species in a precarious situation, as they are so dependent on such specific food; therefore if a problem arises with the abundance of termites, the species as a whole would be affected drastically.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt;

Aardvarks handle captivity well. The first zoo to have one was [[London Zoo]] in 1869, which had an animal from [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name=UR6/&gt;

In [[African folklore]], the aardvark is much admired because of its diligent quest for food and its fearless response to [[army ant|soldier ants]]. [[Hausa people|Hausa]] magicians make a charm from the heart, skin, forehead, and nails of the aardvark, which they then proceed to pound together with the root of a certain tree. Wrapped in a piece of skin and worn on the chest, the charm is said to give the owner the ability to pass through walls or roofs at night. The charm is said to be used by burglars and those seeking to visit young girls without their parents' permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rebecca|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some tribes, such as the [[Mangbetu people|Margbetu]], [[Ayanda]], and [[Logo people|Logo]],&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt; will use aardvark teeth to make bracelets, which are regarded as good luck charms.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; The meat, which has a resemblance to pork, is eaten in certain cultures.&lt;ref name=EoM/&gt;

The ancient [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian god]] [[Set (mythology)|Set]] is usually depicted with the head of an [[Set animal|unidentified animal]], whose similarity to an aardvark has been noted in scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|te Velde|1997|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arthur Read|titular character]] of ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'', an animated television series for children based on a book series and produced by [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]], shown in more than 180 countries, is an aardvark.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|WGBH|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first book of the series, ''Arthur's Nose'' (1976), he has a long, aardvark-like nose,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/arthurs-nose-an-arthur-adventure_marc-brown/317005/item/2746044/ Arthur's Nose], Thriftbooks; accessed 2020.09.29.&lt;/ref&gt; but in later books, his face becomes more rounded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/arthurs-eyes-an-arthur-adventure_marc-brown/464241/item/15015689/ Arthur's Eyes], Thriftbooks; accesses 2020.09.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Otis the Aardvark]] was a puppet character used on [[Children's BBC]] programming.

An aardvark features as the antagonist in the cartoon ''[[The Ant and the Aardvark]]'' as well as in the Canadian animated series ''[[The Raccoons]]''.

The supersonic fighter-bomber [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|F-111/FB-111]] was nicknamed the Aardvark because of its long nose resembling the animal. It also had similarities with its nocturnal missions flown at a very low level employing ordnance that could penetrate deep into the ground. In the US Navy, the squadron [[VF-114]] was nicknamed the Aardvarks, flying [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4]]s and then [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]]s. The squadron mascot was adapted from the animal in the comic strip ''[[B.C. (comic strip)#Animals and other non-human characters|B.C.]]'', which the F-4 was said to resemble.

''[[Cerebus the Aardvark]]'' is a 300-issue comic book series by Dave Sim.

'''Arbroath Abbey''', in the Scottish town of [[Arbroath]], was founded in 1178 by [[William I of Scotland|King William the Lion]] for a group of [[Tironensian]] [[Benedictine]] monks from [[Kelso Abbey]].  It was [[consecration|consecrated]] in 1197 with a dedication to the deceased [[Thomas Becket|Saint Thomas Becket]], whom the king had met at the [[England|English]] court.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Arbroath|volume=2|page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was William's only personal foundation — he was buried before the high altar of the church in 1214.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CE1913|wstitle=Abbey of Arbroath|first=David Oswald Hunter|last= Blair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Abbot was [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[David Beaton]], who in 1522 succeeded his uncle James to become Archbishop of [[St Andrews]].  The Abbey is cared for by [[Historic Environment Scotland]] and is open to the public throughout the year (entrance charge).  The distinctive red [[sandstone]] ruins stand at the top of the High Street in Arbroath.

==History==
[[Image:Arbroath Abbey Seal 01.jpg|thumb|Abbey’s [[Seal (device)|seal]], depicting the murder of St Thomas]]
King William gave the Abbey independence from its founding abbey, [[Kelso Abbey]], and endowed it generously, including income from 24 parishes, land in every royal burgh and more.  The Abbey's monks were allowed to run a market and build a harbour.  King [[John of England]] gave the Abbey permission to buy and sell goods anywhere in [[England]] (except [[London]]) toll-free.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

The Abbey, which was the richest in [[Scotland]], is most famous for its association with the 1320 [[Declaration of Arbroath|Declaration of Scottish Independence]] believed to have been drafted by Abbot [[Bernard of Kilwinning|Bernard]], who was the Chancellor of Scotland under King [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert I]].

The Abbey fell into ruin after the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]].  From 1590 onward, its stones were raided for buildings in the town of [[Arbroath]].  This continued until 1815 when steps were taken to preserve the remaining ruins.

On [[Christmas]] Day 1950, the [[Stone of Scone|Stone of Destiny]] was disappeared from [[Westminster Abbey]]. On April 11, 1951, the missing stone was found lying on the site of the Abbey's altar.

Since 1947, a major historical re-enactment commemorating the Declaration's signing has been held within the roofless remains of the Abbey church.  The celebration is run by the local Arbroath Abbey Pageant Society, and tells the story of the events which led up to the signing.  This is not an annual event. However, a special event to mark the signing is held every year on the 6th of April and involves a street procession and short piece of street theatre.

In 2005 The Arbroath Abbey campaign was launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rampantscotland.com/let051119.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205010415/http://www.rampantscotland.com/let051119.htm |date=2008-02-05 }} Rampant Scotland Newsletter, 19 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign seeks to gain World Heritage Status for the iconic Angus landmark that was the birthplace of one of Scotland's most significant document, The Declaration of Arbroath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/buildings/arbabbey.htm |title=Local History &amp;#124; Historic Buildings &amp;#124; Arbroath Abbey &amp;#124; Angus Council |access-date=2014-01-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220180351/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/buildings/arbabbey.htm |archive-date=2014-02-20 }}Angus Council Website, Arbroath Abbey article (1998–2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigners believe that the Abbey's historical pronouncement makes it a prime candidate to achieve World Heritage Status.

==Architectural description==
[[Image:Arbroath Abbey2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Arbroath Abbey, showing The Round 'O']]
The Abbey was built over some sixty years using local red sandstone, but gives the impression of a single coherent, mainly '[[Early English Period|Early English]]' architectural design, though the round-arched processional doorway in the western front looks back to late [[Normans|Norman]] or transitional work.  The [[triforium]] (open arcade) above the door is unique in Scottish medieval architecture.  It is flanked by twin towers decorated with blind arcading.  The [[cruciform]] church measured {{convert|276|ft|m}} long by {{convert|160|ft|m}} wide.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;  What remains of it today are the [[sacristy]], added by Abbot Paniter in the 15th century, the southern [[transept]], which features Scotland's largest [[lancet window]]s, part of the [[choir]] and [[presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]], the southern half of the [[nave]], parts of the western towers and the western doorway.
The church originally had a central tower and (probably) a spire.  These would once have been visible from many miles over the surrounding countryside, and no doubt once acted as a sea mark for ships.  The soft sandstone of the walls was originally protected by plaster internally and render externally.  These coatings are long gone and much of the architectural detail is sadly eroded, though detached fragments found in the ruins during consolidation give an impression of the original refined, rather austere, architectural effect.

The distinctive round window high in the south transept was originally lit up at night as a [[beacon]] for mariners.  It is known locally as the 'Round O', and from this tradition inhabitants of [[Arbroath]] are colloquially known as 'Reid Lichties' (Scots reid = red).

Little remains of the claustral buildings of the Abbey except for the impressive gatehouse, which stretches between the south-west corner of the church and a defensive tower on the High Street, and the still complete Abbot's House, a building of the 13th, 15th and 16th centuries, which is the best preserved of its type in [[Scotland]].
[[File:ArbroathAbbeyNave.jpg|thumb|left|The [[nave]] of Arbroath Abbey, as observed from the west]]
In the summer of 2001, a new visitors' centre was opened to the public beside the Abbey's west front.  This red sandstone-clad building, with its distinctive 'wave-shaped' organic roof, planted with sedum, houses displays on the history of the Abbey and some of the best surviving stonework and other relics.  The upper storey features a scale model of the Abbey complex, a computer-generated 'fly-through' reconstruction of the church as it was when complete, and a viewing gallery with excellent views of the ruins.  The centre won the 2002 Angus Design Award.  An archaeological investigation of the site of the visitors' centre before building started revealed the foundations of the medieval precinct wall, with a gateway, and stonework discarded during manufacture, showing that the area was the site of the masons' yard while the Abbey was being built.

'''Accounting''', also known as '''accountancy''', is the [[measurement]], processing, and [[communication]] of financial and non financial information about [[economic entity|economic entities]] such as [[business]]es and [[corporation]]s.&lt;ref name = &quot;NP 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Needles |first1=Belverd E. |last2=Powers |first2=Marian |year=2013 |title=Principles of Financial Accounting |publisher=Cengage Learning |edition=12 |series=Financial Accounting Series|title-link=Financial }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |date=November 1940 |title=Accounting Research Bulletins No. 7 Reports of Committee on Terminology |url=http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm/ref/collection/deloitte/id/9342 |publisher=Committee on Accounting Procedure, American Institute of Accountants |access-date=31 December 2013 |archive-date=7 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107100208/http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm/ref/collection/deloitte/id/9342 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounting, which has been called the &quot;language of business&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;wharton-language&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url =http://kwhs.wharton.upenn.edu/2013/09/peggy-bishop-lane-on-why-accounting-is-the-language-of-business/ | title =Peggy Bishop Lane on Why Accounting Is the Language of Business | publisher =Knowledge @ Wharton High School |date =23 September 2013 | access-date =25 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of stakeholders, including [[investor]]s, [[creditor]]s, [[management]], and [[Regulatory agency|regulators]].&lt;ref name = &quot;UW Dept&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foster.washington.edu/academic/departments/accounting/Pages/accounting.aspx |title=Department of Accounting |year=2013 |website=Foster School of Business |publisher=Foster School of Business |access-date=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Practitioners of accounting are known as [[accountant]]s. The terms &quot;accounting&quot; and &quot;[[financial reporting]]&quot; are often used as synonyms.

Accounting can be divided into several fields including [[financial accounting]], [[management accounting]], [[tax accounting]] and [[cost accounting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://361dc.com/accounting-software.php | title=Accounting Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;WC 1981&quot; /&gt; Financial accounting focuses on the reporting of an organization's financial information, including the preparation of [[financial statement]]s, to the external users of the information, such as investors, regulators and [[suppliers]];&lt;ref name = &quot;HDF 2006&quot;/&gt; and management accounting focuses on the measurement, analysis and reporting of information for internal use by management.&lt;ref name = &quot;NP 2013&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;HDF 2006&quot; /&gt; The recording of financial transactions, so that summaries of the financials may be presented in financial reports, is known as [[bookkeeping]], of which [[double-entry bookkeeping]] is the most common system.&lt;ref name = &quot;L 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Lung |first=Henry |year=2009 |title=Fundamentals of Financial Accounting |publisher=Elsevier }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Accounting information system]]s are designed to support accounting functions and related activities.

Accounting has existed in various forms and levels of sophistication throughout human history.

==Etymology==
[[File:Hauptbuch Hochstetter vor 1828.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Early 19th-century [[ledger]]]]
Both the words accounting and accountancy were in use in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] by the mid-1800s, and are derived from the words ''accompting'' and ''accountantship'' used in the 18th century.&lt;ref name = &quot;LN 2009&quot;&gt;Labardin, Pierre, and Marc Nikitin. 2009. &quot;Accounting and the Words to Tell It: An Historical Perspective.&quot; ''Accounting, Business &amp; Financial History'' 19 (2): 149–166.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Middle English]] (used roughly between the 12th and the late 15th century) the verb &quot;to account&quot; had the form ''accounten'', which was derived from the Old French word ''aconter'',&lt;ref name = &quot;B 1984&quot;&gt;Baladouni, Vahé. 1984. &quot;Etymological Observations on Some Accounting Terms.&quot; ''The Accounting Historians Journal'' 11 (2): 101–109.&lt;/ref&gt; which is in turn related to the [[Vulgar Latin]] word ''computare'', meaning &quot;to reckon&quot;. The base of ''computare'' is ''putare'', which &quot;variously meant to prune, to purify, to correct an account, hence, to count or calculate, as well as to think&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;B 1984&quot;/&gt;

The word &quot;[[accountant]]&quot; is derived from the French word {{lang|fr|compter}}, which is also derived from the Italian and [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|computare}}. The word was formerly written in English as &quot;accomptant&quot;, but in process of time the word, which was always pronounced by dropping the &quot;p&quot;, became gradually changed both in [[pronunciation]] and in [[orthography]] to its present form.&lt;ref&gt;Pixley, Francis William: Accountancy—constructive and recording accountancy (Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, Ltd, London, 1900), p4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Terminology ===

Accounting has several subfields or subject areas, including [[financial accounting]], [[management accounting]], [[auditing]], [[taxation]] and [[accounting information system]]s.&lt;ref name = &quot;WC 1981&quot;&gt;Weber, Richard P., and W. C. Stevenson. 1981. &quot;Evaluations of Accounting Journal and Department Quality.&quot; The Accounting Review 56 (3): 596–612.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial accounting===
{{main article|Financial accounting}}
Financial accounting focuses on the reporting of an organization's financial information to external users of the information, such as investors, potential investors and creditors. It calculates and records business transactions and prepares [[financial statement]]s for the external users in accordance with [[generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP).&lt;ref name = &quot;HDF 2006&quot;&gt;{{Citation

Financial accounting produces past-oriented reports—for example financial statements are often published six to ten months after the end of the accounting period—on an [[Annual report|annual]] or quarterly basis, generally about the organization as a whole.&lt;ref name = &quot;HDF 2006&quot; /&gt;

===Management accounting===
{{main article|Management accounting}}
Management accounting focuses on the measurement, analysis and reporting of information that can help managers in making decisions to fulfill the goals of an organization. In management accounting, internal measures and reports are based on [[cost-benefit analysis]], and are not required to follow the generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP).&lt;ref name = &quot;HDF 2006&quot; /&gt; In 2014 CIMA created the [https://www.cgma.org/resources/reports/globalmanagementaccountingprinciples.html Global Management Accounting Principles (GMAPs)]. The result of research from across 20 countries in five continents, the principles aim to guide best practice in the discipline.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=I.|title=New set of accounting principles can help drive sustainable success|newspaper=Financial Times|date=23 October 2014|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0b595a98-59fa-11e4-8771-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk#axzz3Q8Lp1OP9|publisher=ft.com|access-date=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Management accounting produces past-oriented reports with time spans that vary widely, but it also encompasses future-oriented reports such as [[budgets]]. Management accounting reports often include financial and non financial information, and may, for example, focus on specific products and departments.&lt;ref name = &quot;HDF 2006&quot; /&gt;

===Auditing===
{{main article|Financial audit|Internal audit}}
Auditing is the verification of assertions made by others regarding a payoff,&lt;ref name = &quot;B 1979&quot;&gt;Baiman, Stanley. 1979. &quot;Discussion of Auditing: Incentives and Truthful Reporting.&quot; Journal of Accounting Research 17: 25–29.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the context of accounting it is the &quot;[[wiktionary:unbiased|unbiased]] examination and evaluation of the financial statements of an organization&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;I 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/audit.asp |title=Audit Definition |year=2013 |website=Investopedia |publisher= Investopedia US |access-date=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audit is a professional service that is systematic and conventional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tredinnick|first1=Luke|title=Artificial intelligence and professional roles|journal=Business Information Review|date=March 2017|volume=34|issue=1|pages=37–41|doi=10.1177/0266382117692621|s2cid=157743821|url=http://repository.londonmet.ac.uk/3812/3/OOTB-AI.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An audit of financial statements aims to express or disclaim an independent opinion on the financial statements. The auditor expresses an independent opinion on the fairness with which the financial statements presents the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of an entity, in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP) and &quot;in all material respects&quot;. An auditor is also required to identify circumstances in which the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) have not been consistently observed.&lt;ref name = &quot;SAS 1 Responsibilities&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aicpa.org/Research/Standards/AuditAttest/DownloadableDocuments/AU-00110.pdf |title=Responsibilities and Functions of the Independent Auditor |date=November 1972 |website=AICPA |publisher=AICPA |access-date=30 December 2013 |archive-date=23 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210423141039/https://www.aicpa.org/Research/Standards/AuditAttest/DownloadableDocuments/AU-00110.pdf |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information systems===
{{main article|Accounting information system}}
An accounting information system is a part of an organization's [[information system]] used for processing accounting data.&lt;ref name=OpenLearn&gt;{{cite web|title=1.2 Accounting information systems|url=http://labspace.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=365833|work=Introduction to the context of accounting|publisher=OpenLearn|access-date=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many corporations use artificial intelligence-based information systems. The banking and finance industry uses AI in fraud detection. The retail industry uses AI for customer services. AI is also used in the cybersecurity industry. It involves computer hardware and software systems using statistics and modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pathak|first1=Jagdish|last2=Lind|first2=Mary R.|title=Audit Risk, Complex Technology, and Auditing Processes|journal=EDPACS|date=November 2003|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1–9|doi=10.1201/1079/43853.31.5.20031101/78844.1|s2cid=61767095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many accounting practices have been simplified with the help of [[accounting software|accounting computer-based software]]. An [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) system is commonly used for a large organisation and it provides a comprehensive, centralized, integrated source of information that companies can use to manage all major business processes, from purchasing to manufacturing to human resources. These systems can be cloud based and available on demand via application or browser, or available as software installed on specific computers or local servers, often referred to as on-premise.

===Tax accounting===
{{main article|Tax accounting}}
Tax accounting in the United States concentrates on the preparation, analysis and presentation of tax payments and tax returns. The U.S. tax  system requires the use of specialised accounting principles for tax purposes which can differ from the [[generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP) for financial reporting.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2010&quot;&gt;{{ Citation | last1 = Droms| first1= William G.| last2= Wright| first2= Jay O.| title= Finance and Accounting for nonfinancial Managers: All the Basics you need to Know| publisher= Basic Books| year= 2010| edition= 6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. tax law covers four basic forms of business ownership: [[sole proprietorship]], [[partnership]], [[corporation]], and [[limited liability company]]. [[Corporate tax in the United States|Corporate]] and [[Income tax in the United States|personal]] income are taxed at different rates, both varying according to income levels and including varying marginal rates (taxed on each additional dollar of income) and average rates (set as a percentage of overall income).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2010&quot;/&gt;

===Forensic accounting===
{{main article|Forensic accounting}}

Forensic accounting is a specialty practice area of accounting that describes engagements that result from actual or anticipated disputes or [[litigation]]. &quot;[[Forensic science|Forensic]]&quot; means &quot;suitable for use in a court of law&quot;, and it is to that standard and potential outcome that forensic accountants generally have to work.

=== Political campaign accounting ===
{{main article|Political campaign accounting}}
Political campaign accounting deals with the development and implementation of financial systems and the accounting of financial transactions in compliance with laws governing political campaign operations. This branch of accounting was first formally introduced in the March 1976 issue of ''The Journal of Accountancy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Political campaign accounting--New opportunities for the CPA - ProQuest|url=https://www.proquest.com/openview/6fafd43f09605795d38d89129aa6ae75/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=41064|access-date=9 September 2020|website=search.proquest.com|pages=36–41|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Professional accounting bodies]] include the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA) and the other 179 members of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC),&lt;ref name=&quot;ifac&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifac.org/about-ifac/membership/members|title=IFAC Members|publisher=ifac.org|access-date=25 March 2016|archive-date=10 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310092205/http://www.ifac.org/about-ifac/membership/members|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland]] (ICAS), Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP), [[CPA Australia]], [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of India]], [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA) and [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] (ICAEW). Some countries have a single professional accounting body (e.g. Brazil)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bicudo de Castro|first1=Vincent|last2=Mihret|first2=Dessalegn|date=2020|title=Accounting professionalisation in Brazil: Resistance and co-optation in the introduction of a professional entry exam (1999–2010)|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1032373219876669|journal=Accounting History|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=468–487|doi=10.1177/1032373219876669|s2cid=211462361|issn=1032-3732}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in some other countries, professional bodies for subfields of the accounting professions also exist, for example the [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]] (CIMA) in the UK and [[Institute of Management Accountants|Institute of management accountants]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prince&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accountingforsustainability.org/international_network/accounting-bodies-network |title=Accounting Bodies Network |website=The Prince's Accounting for Sustainability Project |access-date=3 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103155739/http://www.accountingforsustainability.org/international_network/accounting-bodies-network |archive-date=3 January 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these professional bodies offer education and training including qualification and administration for various accounting designations, such as certified public accountant ([[AICPA]]) and [[chartered accountant]].&lt;ref name = &quot;AICPA CPA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aicpa.org/BecomeACPA/GettingStarted/Pages/default.aspx |title=Getting Started  |year=2014 |website=AICPA |publisher=AICPA |access-date=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;ICAEW ACA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icaew.com/en/qualifications-and-programmes/aca |title=The ACA Qualification  |year=2014 |website=ICAEW |publisher=ICAEW |access-date=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Firms ===
{{main article|Accounting networks and associations}}

Depending on its size, a company may be legally required to have their [[financial statement]]s [[auditing|audited]] by a qualified auditor, and audits are usually carried out by [[Accounting networks and associations|accounting firms]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Parliament Auditors 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldselect/ldeconaf/119/11904.htm |title= Auditors: Market concentration and their role, CHAPTER 1: Introduction  |year=2011 |website=UK Parliament |publisher=House of Lords |access-date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounting firms grew in the United States and Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and through several mergers there were large international accounting firms by the mid-twentieth century. Further large mergers in the late twentieth century led to the dominance of the auditing market by the &quot;Big Five&quot; accounting firms: [[Arthur Andersen]], [[Deloitte]], [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[KPMG]] and [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Parliament Auditors 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldselect/ldeconaf/119/11905.htm |title= Auditors: Market concentration and their role, CHAPTER 2: Concentration in the audit market |year=2011 |website=UK Parliament |publisher=House of Lords |access-date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arthur Andersen#Demise|demise of Arthur Andersen]] following the [[Enron scandal]] reduced the Big Five to the [[Big Four accounting firms|Big Four]].&lt;ref name = &quot;FT Big Four&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=big-four |title=Definition of big four |year=2014 |website=Financial Times Lexicon |publisher=The Financial Times Ltd |access-date=1 January 2014 |archive-date=2 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102195935/http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=big-four |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standard-setters ===
{{See also|Accounting standards|Convergence of accounting standards}}
[[Generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP) are accounting standards issued by national regulatory bodies. In addition, the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB) issues the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS) implemented by 147 countries.&lt;ref name = &quot;NP 2013&quot; /&gt; Standards for international audit and assurance, ethics, education, and public sector accounting are all set by independent standard settings boards supported by IFAC. The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board sets international standards for auditing, assurance, and quality control; the [[International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants]] (IESBA) &lt;ref name=&quot;ifac2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifac.org/ethics|title=IESBA &amp;#124; Ethics &amp;#124; Accounting &amp;#124; IFAC|publisher=ifac.org|access-date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; sets the internationally appropriate principles-based ''Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants''; the [[International Accounting Education Standards Board]] (IAESB) sets professional accounting education standards;&lt;ref name=&quot;ifac3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifac.org/education|title=IAESB &amp;#124; International Accounting Education Standards Board &amp;#124; IFAC|publisher=ifac.org|access-date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[International Public Sector Accounting Standards]] Board (IPSASB) sets accrual-based international public sector accounting standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;ifac4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifac.org/public-sector|title=IPSASB &amp;#124; International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board &amp;#124; IFAC |publisher=ifac.org|access-date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations in individual countries may issue accounting standards unique to the countries. For example, in Australia, the Australian Accounting Standards Board manages the issuance of the accounting standards in line with IFRS. In the [[United States]] the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB) issues the Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, which form the basis of [[US GAAP]],&lt;ref name = &quot;NP 2013&quot; /&gt; and in the [[United Kingdom]] the [[Financial Reporting Council]] (FRC) sets accounting standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICAEW Standards&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url =http://www.icaew.com/en/library/subject-gateways/accounting-standards/knowledge-guide-to-uk-accounting-standards | title = Knowledge guide to UK Accounting Standards | publisher =ICAEW | year=2014 | access-date =1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2012 &quot;all major economies&quot; have plans to [[Convergence (accounting)|converge]] towards or adopt the IFRS.&lt;ref name=globalcon /&gt;

== Education, training and qualifications ==

=== Degrees ===
At least a [[bachelor's degree]] in accounting or a related field is required for most accountant and [[auditor]] [[Job (role)|job positions]], and some employers prefer applicants with a [[master's degree]].&lt;ref name = &quot;BLS 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Business-and-Financial/Accountants-and-auditors.htm#tab-4 |title=How to Become an Accountant or Auditor |year=2012 |website=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics |publisher=United States Department of Labor |access-date=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A degree in accounting may also be required for, or may be used to fulfill the requirements for, membership to professional accounting bodies. For example, the education during an accounting degree can be used to fulfill the [[AICPA|American Institute of CPA's]] (AICPA) 150 semester hour requirement,&lt;ref name = &quot;AICPA 150&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aicpa.org/becomeacpa/licensure/requirements/pages/default.aspx |title= 150 Hour Requirement for Obtaining CPA Certification |year=2013 |website=AICPA |publisher=AICPA |access-date=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and associate membership with the [[Certified Public Accountants Association]] of the UK is available after gaining a degree in finance or accounting.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACPA Criteria&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acpa.org.uk/criteria-for-entry.aspx |title=Criteria for entry |year=2013 |website=CPA UK |publisher=CPA UK |access-date=31 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819184954/http://acpa.org.uk/criteria-for-entry.aspx |archive-date=19 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] is required in order to pursue a career in accounting [[academia]], for example, to work as a university [[professor]] in accounting.&lt;ref name = &quot;AICPA Academia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/youngcpanetwork/resources/career/pages/acareerineducation.aspx |title=Want a Career in Education?

The PhD is the most common degree for those wishing to pursue a career in academia, while DBA programs generally focus on equipping [[business executives]] for business or public careers requiring research skills and qualifications.&lt;ref name = &quot;AICPA Academia&quot; /&gt;

=== Professional qualifications ===

In the [[United States]], the requirements for joining the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants|AICPA]] as a [[Certified Public Accountant]] are set by the Board of Accountancy of each [[U.S. state|state]], and members agree to abide by the AICPA's [[Code of conduct|Code of Professional Conduct]] and Bylaws.

The ACCA is the largest global accountancy body with over 320,000 members, and the organisation provides an 'IFRS stream' and a 'UK stream'. Students must pass a total of 14 exams, which are arranged across three levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.careersinaudit.com/article/european-accounting-qualifications-explained/|title=European Accounting Qualifications Explained {{!}} CareersinAudit.com|work=CareersinAudit.com|access-date=13 December 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
{{Main article|Accounting research}}
Accounting research is [[research]] in the effects of economic events on the process of accounting, the effects of reported information on economic events, and the roles of accounting in organizations and society.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACCA 2010&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.accaglobal.com/content/dam/acca/global/PDF-technical/human-capital/rr-120-002.pdf |title=The Relevance and Utility of Leading Accounting Research |publisher=The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants |year=2010 |access-date=27 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227111624/http://www.accaglobal.com/content/dam/acca/global/PDF-technical/human-capital/rr-120-002.pdf |archive-date=27 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Burchell et al 1980&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burchell |first1=S. |last2=Clubb |first2=C. |last3=Hopwood |first3=A. |last4=Hughes |first4=J. |last5=Nahapiet |first5=J. |title=The roles of accounting in organizations and society |journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society |date=1980 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=5–27|doi=10.1016/0361-3682(80)90017-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It encompasses a broad range of research areas including [[financial accounting]], [[management accounting]], [[auditing]] and [[taxation]].&lt;ref name = &quot;OOS 2010&quot;&gt;Oler, Derek K., Mitchell J. Oler, and Christopher J. Skousen. 2010. &quot;Characterizing Accounting Research.&quot; ''Accounting Horizons'' 24 (4): 635–670.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounting research is carried out both by academic researchers and practicing accountants. [[Methodology|Methodologies]] in academic accounting research include archival research, which examines &quot;objective data collected from [[Information repository|repositories]]&quot;; experimental research, which examines data &quot;the researcher gathered by [[Controlled experiments|administering treatments to subjects]]&quot;; analytical research, which is &quot;based on the act of [[Scientific modelling|formally modeling]] [[Theory|theories]] or substantiating ideas in mathematical terms&quot;; [[Antipositivism|interpretive]] research, which emphasizes the role of language, interpretation and understanding in accounting practice, &quot;highlighting the symbolic structures and taken-for-granted themes which pattern the world in distinct ways&quot;; [[critical theory|critical]] research, which emphasizes the role of power and conflict in accounting practice; [[Case study|case studies]]; [[computer simulation]]; and [[field research]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CSWW 2010&quot;&gt;Coyne, Joshua G., Scott L.

Empirical studies document that leading [[List of accounting journals|accounting journals]] publish in total fewer research articles than comparable journals in economics and other business disciplines,&lt;ref name=&quot;JAE 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buchheit |first1=S. |last2=Collins |first2=D. |last3=Reitenga |first3=A. |title=A cross-discipline comparison of top-tier academic journal publication rates: 1997–1999 |journal=Journal of Accounting Education |year=2002 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=123–130|doi=10.1016/S0748-5751(02)00003-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and consequently, accounting scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author-last1=Merigo |author-first1=Jose M. |author-last2=Yang |author-first2=Jian-Bo |date=2017|title=Accounting Research: A Bibliometric Analysis |journal=Australian Accounting Review | volume=27 | pages=71–100 |doi=10.1111/auar.12109 |issn=1835-2561|url=https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/accounting-research-a-bibliometric-analysis(ea600e0c-236f-4141-9246-7503d612b0c5).html }}&lt;/ref&gt; are relatively less successful in [[academic publishing]] than their [[business school]] peers.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAR 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Swanson |first1=Edward |title=Publishing in the majors: A comparison of accounting, finance, management, and marketing |journal=Contemporary Accounting Research |year=2004 |volume=21 |pages=223–255|doi=10.1506/RCKM-13FM-GK0E-3W50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to different publication rates between accounting and other business disciplines, a recent study based on academic author rankings concludes that the competitive value of a single publication in a top-ranked journal is highest in accounting and lowest in marketing.&lt;ref name=&quot;JBR 2018&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Korkeamäki |first1=Timo |last2=Sihvonen |first2=Jukka |last3=Vähämaa |first3=Sami |title= Evaluating publications across business disciplines |journal=Journal of Business Research |year=2018 |volume=84 |pages=220–232 |doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2017.11.024 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandals==
{{Main article|Accounting scandals}}
{{See also|Accounting ethics}}
The year 2001 witnessed a series of financial information frauds involving [[Enron]], auditing firm [[Arthur Andersen]], the telecommunications company [[WorldCom]], [[Qwest]] and [[Jarden|Sunbeam]], among other well-known corporations. These problems highlighted the need to review the effectiveness of [[Standard accounting practice|accounting standards]], auditing regulations and [[corporate governance]] principles. In some cases, management manipulated the figures shown in financial reports to indicate a better economic performance. In others, tax and regulatory incentives encouraged over-leveraging of companies and decisions to bear extraordinary and unjustified risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;mba.ufm.edu.gt&quot;&gt;Astrid Ayala and Giancarlo Ibárgüen Snr.: &quot;A Market Proposal for Auditing the Financial Statements of Public Companies&quot; (Journal of Management of Value, [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]], March 2006) p. 41, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084545/http://www.mba.ufm.edu.gt/journalofmanagement/content/ENG_MarketProposal.pdf UFM.edu.gt]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Enron scandal]] deeply influenced the development of new [[regulations]] to improve the reliability of financial reporting, and increased public awareness about the importance of having accounting standards that show the financial reality of companies and the objectivity and independence of auditing firms.&lt;ref name=&quot;mba.ufm.edu.gt&quot;/&gt;

In addition to being the largest [[bankruptcy]] reorganization in American history, the Enron scandal undoubtedly is the biggest audit failure&lt;ref&gt;Bratton, William W. &quot;Enron and the Dark Side of Shareholder Value&quot; ([[Tulane Law Review]], New Orleans, May 2002) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; causing the dissolution of [[Arthur Andersen]], which at the time was one of the five largest accounting firms in the world. After a series of revelations involving irregular accounting procedures conducted throughout the 1990s, Enron filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection in December 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Enron files for bankruptcy | work = BBC News | date = 3 December 2001 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1688550.stm | access-date = 15 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence of these events was the passage of the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] in the [[United States]] in 2002, as a result of the first admissions of fraudulent behavior made by Enron. The act significantly raises criminal penalties for [[securities fraud]], for destroying, altering or fabricating records in federal investigations or any scheme or attempt to defraud shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Aiyesha Dey, and Thomas Z. Lys: &quot;Trends in Earnings Management and Informativeness of Earnings Announcements in the Pre- and Post-Sarbanes Oxley Periods ([[Kellogg School of Management]], Evanston, Illinois, February, 2005) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fraud and error ==
Accounting [[fraud]] is an intentional misstatement or omission in the accounting records by management or employees which involves the use of deception. It is a criminal act and a breach of civil tort. It may involve collusion with third parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAASB-ISA240&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title =2018 Handbook of International Quality Control, Auditing, Review, Other Assurance, and Related Services Pronouncements | publisher =The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board | date =December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An accounting error is an unintentional misstatement or omission in the accounting records, for example misinterpretation of facts, mistakes in processing data, or oversights leading to incorrect estimates.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAASB-ISA240&quot;/&gt; Acts leading to accounting errors are not criminal but may breach civil law, for example, the tort of [[negligence]].

The primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud and errors rests with the entity's management.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAASB-ISA240&quot;/&gt;

'''Ants''' are [[Eusociality|eusocial]] [[insect]]s of the [[Family (biology)|family]] '''Formicidae''' and, along with the related [[wasp]]s and [[bee]]s, belong to the [[Taxonomy (biology)|order]] [[Hymenoptera]]. Ants evolved from [[Vespoidea|vespoid wasp]] ancestors in the [[Cretaceous]] period. More than 13,800 of an estimated total of 22,000 [[species]] have been classified. They are easily identified by their geniculate (elbowed) [[Antenna (biology)|antenna]]e and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.

Ants form [[Ant colony|colonies]] that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals. Larger colonies consist of various castes of sterile, wingless females, most of which are workers (ergates), as well as soldiers (dinergates) and other specialised groups. Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called &quot;drones&quot; and one or more fertile females called &quot;[[Queen ant|queens]]&quot; ([[gyne]]s). The colonies are described as [[superorganism]]s because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity, collectively working together to support the colony.
[[File:Blackants-bredcrust-tokyo-may2015.webm|thumb|(video) Ants gathering food]]

Ants have colonised almost every landmass on [[Earth]]. The only places lacking [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] ants are [[Antarctica]] and a few remote or inhospitable islands. Ants thrive in most ecosystems and may form 15–25% of the [[terrestrial animal]] [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. Their success in so many environments has been attributed to their social organisation and their ability to modify habitats, tap resources, and defend themselves. Their long [[co-evolution]] with other species has led to [[mimicry|mimetic]], [[commensalism|commensal]], [[parasitism|parasitic]], and [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationships.

Ant societies have [[division of labour]], communication between individuals, and an ability to [[Problem solving|solve complex problems]]. These parallels with [[Civilization|human societies]] have long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rites. Some species are valued in their role as [[biological pest control]] agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the [[red imported fire ant]] (''Solenopsis invicta'') of South America, are regarded as [[invasive species]] in other parts of the world, establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally.

==Etymology==
The word ''ant'' and the chiefly dialectal form ''emmet''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/emmet emmet]. Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; come from ''{{lang|enm|ante}}'', ''{{lang|enm|emete}}'' of [[Middle English]], which come from ''{{lang|ang|ǣmette}}'' of [[Old English]]; these are all related to [[Low German|Low Saxon]] ''{{lang|nds|e(e)mt}}'', ''{{lang|nds|empe}}'' and varieties ([[Old Saxon]] ''{{lang|osx|emeta}}'') and to [[German language|German]] ''{{lang|de|Ameise}}'' ([[Old High German]] ''{{lang|goh|āmeiza}}''). All of these words come from West Germanic ''*{{lang|gmw|ǣmaitjōn}}'', and the original meaning of the word was &quot;the biter&quot; (from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|ai-}}'', &quot;off, away&quot; + ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|mait-}}'' &quot;cut&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ant |title=ant|publisher= Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |access-date=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ant |title=Ant.

The family Formicidae belongs to the order [[Hymenoptera]], which also includes [[sawfly|sawflies]], [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s. Ants evolved from a lineage within the [[Aculeata|stinging wasps]], and a 2013 study suggests that they are a sister group of the [[Apoidea]].&lt;ref name=phylo /&gt; In 1966, [[E. O. Wilson]] and his colleagues identified the [[fossil]] remains of an ant (''[[Sphecomyrma]]'') that lived in the [[Cretaceous]] period.

[[Image:Ants in amber.jpg|thumb|right|Ants fossilised in [[Baltic amber]]]]
During the Cretaceous period, a few species of primitive ants ranged widely on the [[Laurasia]]n supercontinent (the [[Northern Hemisphere]]). Their representation in the fossil record is poor, in comparison to the populations of other insects, representing only about 1% of fossil evidence of insects in the era. Ants became dominant after [[adaptive radiation]] at the beginning of the [[Paleogene period]]. By the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]], ants had come to represent 20–40% of all insects found in major fossil deposits. Of the species that lived in the [[Eocene]] epoch, around one in 10 genera survive to the present. Genera surviving today comprise 56% of the genera in [[Baltic amber]] fossils (early Oligocene), and 92% of the genera in [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] amber fossils (apparently early Miocene).&lt;ref name=&quot;grimaldi2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheAntEvo&gt;Hölldobler &amp; Wilson (1990), pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Termite]]s live in colonies and are sometimes called ‘white ants’, but termites are not ants. They are the sub-order [[Isoptera]], and together with [[cockroach]]es they form the order [[Blattodea]]. Blattodeans are related to [[mantid]]s, [[crickets]], and other winged insects that do not undergo full [[metamorphosis]]. Like ants, termites are [[eusociality|eusocial]], with sterile workers, but they differ greatly in the genetics of reproduction. The similarity of their social structure to that of ants is attributed to [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Thorne BL |year=1997 |title=Evolution of eusociality in termites |journal=Annu.

==Morphology==
[[Image:Scheme ant worker anatomy-en.svg|thumb|450px|left|Diagram of a worker ant (''[[Neoponera verenae]]'')]]

Ants are distinct in their [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] from other insects in having geniculate (elbowed) [[Antenna (biology)|antenna]]e, [[metapleural gland]]s, and a strong constriction of their second [[Abdomen|abdominal]] segment into a node-like [[petiole (insect anatomy)|petiole]]. The head, [[mesosoma]], and [[metasoma]] are the three distinct body segments (formally [[Tagma (biology)|tagmata]]). The petiole forms a narrow waist between their mesosoma ([[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]] plus the first abdominal segment, which is fused to it) and [[gaster (insect anatomy)|gaster]] (abdomen less the abdominal segments in the petiole). The [[Petiole (insect anatomy)|petiole]] may be formed by one or two nodes (the second alone, or the second and third abdominal segments).&lt;ref&gt;Borror, Triplehorn &amp; Delong (1989), p. 737&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other insects, ants have an [[exoskeleton]], an external covering that provides a protective casing around the body and a point of attachment for muscles, in contrast to the internal skeletons of humans and other [[vertebrate]]s. Insects do not have [[lung]]s; [[oxygen]] and other gases, such as [[carbon dioxide]], pass through their exoskeleton via tiny valves called [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s. Insects also lack closed [[blood vessel]]s; instead, they have a long, thin, perforated tube along the top of the body (called the &quot;[[dorsal aorta]]&quot;) that functions like a heart, and pumps [[haemolymph]] toward the head, thus driving the circulation of the internal fluids. The [[nervous system]] consists of a [[ventral nerve cord]] that runs the length of the body, with several [[ganglia]] and branches along the way reaching into the extremities of the appendages.&lt;ref name=&quot;insectmorph&quot;&gt;Borror, Triplehorn &amp; Delong (1989), pp. 24–71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Head===

[[File:Ant Head.jpg|thumb|Ant head]]

An ant's head contains many [[sensory organs]]. Like most insects, ants have [[compound eye]]s made from numerous tiny lenses attached together. Ant eyes are good for acute movement detection, but do not offer a high [[Optical resolution|resolution]] image. They also have three small [[ocellus|ocelli]] (simple eyes) on the top of the head that detect light levels and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fent K, Wehner R | title = Oceili: a celestial compass in the desert ant cataglyphis | journal = Science | volume = 228 | issue = 4696 | pages = 192–4 | date = April 1985 | pmid = 17779641 | doi = 10.1126/science.228.4696.192 | s2cid = 33242108 | bibcode = 1985Sci...228..192F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to [[vertebrate]]s, ants tend to have blurrier eyesight, particularly in smaller species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palavalli-Nettimi R, Narendra A | title = Miniaturisation decreases visual navigational competence in ants | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 221 | issue = Pt 7 | page = jeb177238 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29487158 | doi = 10.1242/jeb.177238 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a few [[Subterranea (geography)|subterranean]] taxa are completely [[Blindness|blind]].&lt;ref name=Ward /&gt; However, some ants, such as Australia's [[Myrmecia (ant)|bulldog ant]], have excellent vision and are capable of discriminating the distance and size of objects moving nearly a [[Metre|meter]] away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=119| pages=115–131| year=1985| title=Attack behaviour and distance perception in the Australian bulldog ant ''Myrmecia nigriceps''| vauthors = Eriksson ES |url= http://jeb.biologists.org/content/119/1/115.full.pdf | issue=1|doi=10.1242/jeb.119.1.115| doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] (&quot;feelers&quot;) are attached to the head; these organs detect chemicals, [[air current]]s, and [[vibration]]s; they also are used to transmit and receive signals through touch. The head has two strong jaws, the [[Mandible (insect)|mandibles]], used to carry food, manipulate objects, construct nests, and for defence.&lt;ref name=&quot;insectmorph&quot;/&gt; In some species, a small pocket (infrabuccal chamber) inside the mouth stores food, so it may be passed to other ants or their larvae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eisner T, Happ GM | title=The infrabuccal pocket of a formicine ant: a social filtration device | journal=Psyche | volume=69 | pages=107–116 | year=1962 | doi=10.1155/1962/25068 | issue=3| doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesosoma===
Both the [[arthropod leg|legs]] and [[insect wing|wings]] of the ant are attached to the [[mesosoma]] (&quot;thorax&quot;). The legs terminate in a hooked [[Chelae|claw]] which allows them to hook on and climb surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Holbrook, Tate|title=Ask a Biologist: Face to Face with Ants|date=22 September 2009|publisher=ASU School of Life Sciences|url=https://askabiologist.asu.edu/explore/ant-anatomy|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only reproductive ants ([[Queen (insect)|queens]] and males) have wings. Queens shed their wings after the [[nuptial flight]], leaving visible stubs, a distinguishing feature of queens. In a few species, wingless queens ([[ergatoid]]s) and males occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;insectmorph&quot;/&gt;

===Metasoma===
The [[metasoma]] (the &quot;abdomen&quot;) of the ant houses important internal organs, including those of the reproductive, respiratory (tracheae), and excretory systems. Workers of many species have their [[ovipositor|egg-laying structures]] modified into [[stinger (organ)|stings]] that are used for subduing [[predation|prey]] and defending their nests.&lt;ref name=&quot;insectmorph&quot;/&gt;

===Polymorphism===
[[Image:Atta.cephalotes.gamut.selection.jpg|thumb|right|Seven [[leafcutter ant]] workers of various castes (left) and two queens (right)]]

In the colonies of a few ant species, there are physical castes—workers in distinct size-classes, called minor, median, and major ergates. Often, the larger ants have disproportionately larger heads, and correspondingly stronger [[mandible (insect)|mandibles]]. These are known as macrergates while smaller workers are known as micrergates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Rajendra | name-list-style=vanc |title=Elements of Entomology|year=2006|publisher=Rastogi Publications|isbn=9788171336777|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although formally known as dinergates, such individuals are sometimes called &quot;soldier&quot; ants because their stronger mandibles make them more effective in fighting, although they still are workers and their &quot;duties&quot; typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median workers. In a few species, the median workers are absent, creating a sharp divide between the minors and majors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson EO | title = The origin and evolution of polymorphism in ants | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 136–56 | date = June 1953 | pmid = 13074471 | doi = 10.1086/399512 | s2cid = 4560071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Weaver ant]]s, for example, have a distinct [[bimodal]] size distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Weber, NA|year=1946|title=Dimorphism in the African ''Oecophylla'' worker and an anomaly (Hym.: Formicidae)|journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America|volume=39|pages=7–10| url=http://antbase.org/ants/publications/10434/10434.pdf|doi=10.1093/aesa/39.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Edward O. | last1 = Wilson | first2 = Robert W. | last2 = Taylor | name-list-style=vanc|year=1964|title=A Fossil Ant Colony: New Evidence of Social Antiquity |journal=Psyche|volume=71|pages=93–103|url=http://psyche.entclub.org/pdf/71/71-093.pdf |doi=10.1155/1964/17612 |issue=2|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other species show continuous variation in the size of workers.

Workers cannot mate; however, because of the [[haplodiploid sex-determination system]] in ants, workers of a number of species can lay unfertilised eggs that become fully fertile, haploid males. The role of workers may change with their age and in some species, such as [[honeypot ants]], young workers are fed until their gasters are distended, and act as living food storage vessels. These food storage workers are called ''repletes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Børgesen LW |year=2000 |title=Nutritional function of replete workers in the pharaoh's ant, ''Monomorium pharaonis'' (L.)|journal=Insectes Sociaux |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=141–146 |doi=10.1007/PL00001692|s2cid=31953751 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, these replete workers develop in the North American honeypot ant ''[[Myrmecocystus mexicanus]]''.

===Genome size===
[[Genome size]] is a fundamental characteristic of an organism. Ants have been found to have tiny genomes, with the evolution of genome size suggested to occur through loss and accumulation of [[non-coding DNA|non-coding]] regions, mainly [[transposable element]]s, and occasionally by whole genome duplication.&lt;ref name=&quot;moura&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Moura, Mariana Neves|author2=Cardoso, Danon Clemes|author3=Cristiano, Maykon Passos|title=The tight genome size of ants: diversity and evolution under ancestral state reconstruction and base composition|year=2021|journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=193|issue=1|pages=124–144|doi=10.1093/zoolinnean/zlaa135|issn=0024-4082|url=https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/193/1/124/6036549}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be related to [[colonisation]] processes, but further studies are needed to verify this.&lt;ref name=&quot;moura&quot;/&gt;

==Life cycle==
[[Image:Meat eater ant nest swarming02.jpg|thumb|[[Meat eater ant]] nest during swarming]]
The life of an ant starts from an [[egg]]; if the egg is fertilised, the progeny will be female [[diploid]], if not, it will be male [[haploid]]. Ants develop by [[complete metamorphosis]] with the [[larva]] stages passing through a [[pupa]]l stage before emerging as an adult. The larva is largely immobile and is fed and cared for by workers. Food is given to the larvae by [[trophallaxis]], a process in which an ant [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitates]] liquid food held in its [[Crop (anatomy)|crop]]. This is also how adults share food, stored in the &quot;social stomach&quot;. Larvae, especially in the later stages, may also be provided solid food, such as [[trophic egg]]s, pieces of prey, and seeds brought by workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Hölldobler B, Wilson EO |title=The Ants|url=https://archive.org/details/ants0000hlld |url-access=registration |year=1990 |publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-04075-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/ants0000hlld/page/n316 291]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The larvae grow through a series of four or five [[moult]]s and enter the pupal stage. The pupa has the appendages free and not fused to the body as in a [[Chrysalis|butterfly pupa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gillott, Cedric |year=1995|title=Entomology|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-44967-3|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; The differentiation into queens and workers (which are both female), and different [[caste (biology)|castes]] of workers, is influenced in some species by the nutrition the larvae obtain. Genetic influences and the [[polyphenism|control of gene expression]] by the developmental environment are complex and the determination of caste continues to be a subject of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The causes and consequences of genetic caste determination in ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) |first1=Kirk E. |last1=Anderson |first2=Timothy A. |last2=Linksvayer |first3=Chris R. |last3=Smith  | name-list-style=vanc |journal=Myrmecol.

Some species, such as [[army ant]]s, have wingless queens. Larvae and pupae need to be kept at fairly constant temperatures to ensure proper development, and so often are moved around among the various brood chambers within the colony.&lt;ref&gt;Hölldobler &amp; Wilson (1990), pp. 351, 372&lt;/ref&gt;

A new ergate spends the first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young. She then graduates to digging and other nest work, and later to defending the nest and foraging. These changes are sometimes fairly sudden, and define what are called temporal castes. An explanation for the sequence is suggested by the high casualties involved in foraging, making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|year=1989|volume=34|pages=191–210|title=Foraging strategies of ants|author=Traniello JFA|doi=10.1146/annurev.en.34.010189.001203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sorensen A, Busch TM, Vinson SB |title=Behavioral flexibility of temporal sub-castes in the fire ant, ''Solenopsis invicta'', in response to food|journal=Psyche|volume=91|pages=319–332|year=1984|doi=10.1155/1984/39236|issue=3–4|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ant colonies can be long-lived. The queens can live for up to 30&amp;nbsp;years, and workers live from 1 to 3&amp;nbsp;years.

Ants are active all year long in the tropics, but, in cooler regions, they survive the winter in a state of dormancy known as [[hibernation]]. The forms of inactivity are varied and some temperate species have larvae going into the inactive state ([[diapause]]), while in others, the adults alone pass the winter in a state of reduced activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kipyatkov VE|year=2001|title=Seasonal life cycles and the forms of dormancy in ants (Hymenoptera, Formicoidea)|journal=Acta Societatis Zoologicae Bohemicae|volume=65|issue=2|pages=198–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drones can also mate with existing queens by entering a foreign colony, such as in [[army ant]]s. When the drone is initially attacked by the workers, it releases a mating [[pheromone]].

Males then use visual cues to find a common mating ground, for example, a landmark such as a [[pine tree]] to which other males in the area converge. Males secrete a mating pheromone that females follow. Males will mount females in the air, but the actual mating process usually takes place on the ground.

Mated females then seek a suitable place to begin a colony. There, they break off their wings using their tibial spurs and begin to lay and care for eggs. The females can selectively fertilise future eggs with the sperm stored to produce diploid workers or lay unfertilized haploid eggs to produce drones.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Communication===
[[File:Camponotus sericeus Senegal.jpg|thumb|Two ''[[Camponotus sericeus]]'' workers communicating through touch and pheromones]]
Ants communicate with each other using [[pheromone]]s, sounds, and touch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jackson DE, Ratnieks FL | title = Communication in ants | journal = Current Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 15 | pages = R570–4 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16890508 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2006.07.015 | s2cid = 5835320 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Goss S, Aron S, Deneubourg JL, Pasteels JM |year=1989|title=Self-organized shortcuts in the Argentine ant|journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=76 |pages=579–581 |doi=10.1007/BF00462870 |issue=12|url=http://www.ulb.ac.be/sciences/use/publications/JLD/56.pdf|bibcode = 1989NW.....76..579G |s2cid=18506807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ants use pheromones for more than just making trails. A crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away.

Ants attack and defend themselves by biting and, in many species, by stinging often injecting or spraying chemicals. [[Paraponera clavata|Bullet ant]]s (''[[Paraponera clavata|Paraponera]]''), located in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], are considered to have the most painful sting of any insect, although it is usually not fatal to humans.

[[Image:WeaverAntDefense.JPG|thumb|left|A [[weaver ant]] in fighting position, [[mandible (insect)|mandibles]] wide open]]
Trap-jaw ants of the genus ''[[Odontomachus]]'' are equipped with mandibles called trap-jaws, which snap shut faster than any other [[predatory]] [[appendage]]s within the [[animalia|animal kingdom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TrapJawPatek&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Patek SN, Baio JE, Fisher BL, Suarez AV |title=Multifunctionality and mechanical origins: ballistic jaw propulsion in trap-jaw ants |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=103 |issue=34 |pages=12787–92 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16924120 |pmc=1568925 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0604290103 |bibcode=2006PNAS..10312787P|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study of ''[[Odontomachus bauri]]'' recorded peak speeds of between {{convert|126|and|230|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, with the jaws closing within 130 [[microsecond]]s on average.
The ants were also observed to use their jaws as a [[catapult]] to eject intruders or fling themselves backward to escape a threat.&lt;ref name=&quot;TrapJawPatek&quot; /&gt; Before striking, the ant opens its mandibles extremely widely and locks them in this position by an internal mechanism. Energy is stored in a thick band of [[muscle]] and explosively released when triggered by the stimulation of [[sensory receptor|sensory]] organs resembling hairs on the inside of the mandibles. The mandibles also permit slow and fine movements for other tasks.

[[Camponotus saundersi|A Malaysian species of ant]] in the ''[[Camponotus]]'' ''cylindricus'' [[superspecies|group]] has enlarged mandibular glands that extend into their gaster. If combat takes a turn for the worse, a worker may perform a final act of [[autothysis|suicidal altruism]] by rupturing the membrane of its gaster, causing the content of its mandibular glands to burst from the [[anterior]] region of its head, spraying a poisonous, corrosive secretion containing [[acetophenone]]s and other chemicals that immobilise small insect attackers.

[[Image:Ant mound.jpg|thumb|Ant mound holes prevent water from entering the nest during rain.]]
In addition to defence against predators, ants need to protect their colonies from [[pathogen]]s.

===Learning===
[[File:&quot;Follow the leader&quot;.jpg|thumb|Two Weaver ants walking in [[Tandem running|tandem]].]]
Many animals can learn behaviours by imitation, but ants may be the only group apart from [[mammal]]s where interactive teaching has been observed. A knowledgeable forager of ''[[Temnothorax albipennis]]'' can lead a naïve nest-mate to newly discovered food by the process of [[tandem running]]. The follower obtains knowledge through its leading tutor. The leader is acutely sensitive to the progress of the follower and slows down when the follower lags and speeds up when the follower gets too close.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franks NR, Richardson T | title = Teaching in tandem-running ants | journal = Nature | volume = 439 | issue = 7073 | pages = 153 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16407943 | doi = 10.1038/439153a | bibcode = 2006Natur.439..153F | s2cid = 4416276 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controlled experiments with colonies of ''[[Cerapachys biroi]]'' suggest that an individual may choose nest roles based on her previous experience. An entire generation of identical workers was divided into two groups whose outcome in food foraging was controlled. One group was continually rewarded with prey, while it was made certain that the other failed. As a result, members of the successful group intensified their foraging attempts while the unsuccessful group ventured out fewer and fewer times. A month later, the successful foragers continued in their role while the others had moved to specialise in brood care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ravary F, Lecoutey E, Kaminski G, Châline N, Jaisson P | title = Individual experience alone can generate lasting division of labor in ants | journal = Current Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 15 | pages = 1308–12 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17629482 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2007.06.047 | s2cid = 13273984 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nest construction===
{{Main|Ant colony}}
[[Image:WeaverAntNest.JPG|thumb|Leaf nest of [[weaver ants]], [[Pamalican]], [[Philippines]]]]

Complex nests are built by many ant species, but other species are nomadic and do not build permanent structures. Ants may form subterranean nests or build them on trees. These nests may be found in the ground, under stones or logs, inside logs, hollow stems, or even acorns. The materials used for construction include soil and plant matter,&lt;ref name = HolldoblerWilsonAnts2/&gt; and ants carefully select their nest sites; ''Temnothorax albipennis'' will avoid sites with dead ants, as these may indicate the presence of pests or disease. They are quick to abandon established nests at the first sign of threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franks NR, Hooper J, Webb C, Dornhaus A | title = Tomb evaders: house-hunting hygiene in ants | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 190–2 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 17148163 | pmc = 1626204 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2005.0302 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[army ant]]s of South America, such as the ''[[Eciton burchellii]]'' species, and the [[driver ant]]s of Africa do not build permanent nests, but instead, alternate between nomadism and stages where the workers form a temporary nest ([[bivouac (ants)|bivouac]]) from their own bodies, by holding each other together.&lt;ref&gt;Hölldobler &amp; Wilson (1990), p. 573&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Weaver ant]] (''Oecophylla'' spp.) workers build nests in trees by attaching leaves together, first pulling them together with bridges of workers and then inducing their larvae to produce silk as they are moved along the leaf edges. Similar forms of nest construction are seen in some species of ''[[Polyrhachis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Robson SK, Kohout RJ |year=2005|title=Evolution of nest-weaving behaviour in arboreal nesting ants of the genus ''Polyrhachis'' Fr.

''[[Formica polyctena]]'', among other ant species, constructs nests that maintain a relatively constant interior temperature that aids in the development of larvae. The ants maintain the nest temperature by choosing the location, nest materials, controlling ventilation and maintaining the heat from solar radiation, worker activity and metabolism, and in some moist nests, microbial activity in the nest materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Frouz J |title=The Effect of Nest Moisture on Daily Temperature Regime in the Nests of ''Formica polyctena'' Wood Ants|journal=Insectes Sociaux| volume=47 |issue=3|year=2000|pages=229–235|doi=10.1007/PL00001708|s2cid=955282}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kadochová|first1=Štěpánka|last2=Frouz|first2=Jan|date=2013|title=Thermoregulation strategies in ants in comparison to other social insects, with a focus on red wood ants ( Formica rufa group)|journal=F1000Research|volume=2|page=280|doi=10.12688/f1000research.2-280.v2|issn=2046-1402|pmc=3962001|pmid=24715967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called ''[[gongylidia]]''.

In hot and arid regions, day-foraging ants face death by [[desiccation]], so the ability to find the shortest route back to the nest reduces that risk.

===Locomotion===
The female worker ants do not have wings and reproductive females lose their wings after their mating flights in order to begin their colonies. Therefore, unlike their wasp ancestors, most ants travel by walking. Some species are capable of leaping. For example, Jerdon's jumping ant (''[[Harpegnathos saltator]]'') is able to jump by synchronising the action of its mid and hind pairs of legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baroni-Urbani C, Boyan GS, Blarer A, Billen J, Musthak Ali TM |year=1994 |title=A novel mechanism for jumping in the Indian ant ''Harpegnathos saltator'' (Jerdon) (Formicidae, Ponerinae) |journal=[[Experientia]] |volume=50 |pages=63–71 |doi=10.1007/BF01992052|s2cid=42304237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several species of [[gliding ant]] including ''Cephalotes atratus''; this may be a common trait among arboreal ants with small colonies. Ants with this ability are able to control their horizontal movement so as to catch tree trunks when they fall from atop the forest canopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yanoviak SP, Dudley R, Kaspari M | title = Directed aerial descent in canopy ants | journal = Nature | volume = 433 | issue = 7026 | pages = 624–6 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15703745 | doi = 10.1038/nature03254 | url = http://www.canopyants.com/Nature05.pdf | url-status = dead | bibcode = 2005Natur.433..624Y | s2cid = 4368995 | archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070616090223/http://www.canopyants.com/Nature05.pdf | archive-date = 2007-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other species of ants can form chains to bridge gaps over water, underground, or through spaces in vegetation. Some species also form floating rafts that help them survive floods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mlot&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mlot NJ, Tovey CA, Hu DL | title = Fire ants self-assemble into waterproof rafts to survive floods | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 19 | pages = 7669–73 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21518911 | pmc = 3093451 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1016658108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..108.7669M | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These rafts may also have a role in allowing ants to colonise islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Morrison LW|year=1998|title=A review of Bahamian ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) biogeography|journal=Journal of Biogeography|volume=25|issue=3|pages=561–571|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.1998.2530561.x|s2cid=84923599 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Polyrhachis sokolova]]'', a species of ant found in [[Australia]]n [[mangrove]] swamps, can swim and live in underwater nests.

===Cooperation and competition===
[[File:Ants eating cicada, jjron 22.11.2009.jpg|thumb|right|[[Meat ant|Meat-eater ants]] feeding on a [[cicada]]: social ants cooperate and collectively gather food]]
Not all ants have the same kind of societies. The Australian [[bulldog ant]]s are among the biggest and most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] of ants. Like virtually all ants, they are [[Eusociality|eusocial]], but their social behaviour is poorly developed compared to other species. Each individual hunts alone, using her large eyes instead of chemical senses to find prey.&lt;ref name=Crosland1988&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-6055.1988.tb01179.x | title = Aspects of the biology of the primitive ant genus Myrmecia F.

Some species attack and take over neighbouring ant colonies. Extreme specialists among these [[slave-raiding ant]]s, such as the [[Polyergus|Amazon ant]]s, are incapable of feeding themselves and need captured workers to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diehl E, Junqueira LK, Berti-Filho E | title = Ant and termite mound coinhabitants in the wetlands of Santo Antonio da Patrulha, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil | journal = Brazilian Journal of Biology | volume = 65 | issue = 3 | pages = 431–7 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16341421 | doi = 10.1590/S1519-69842005000300008 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Captured workers of enslaved ''[[Temnothorax]]'' species have evolved a counter-strategy, destroying just the female pupae of the slave-making ''[[Temnothorax americanus]]'', but sparing the males (who do not take part in slave-raiding as adults).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Achenbach A, Foitzik S | title = First evidence for slave rebellion: enslaved ant workers systematically kill the brood of their social parasite protomognathus americanus | journal = Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 1068–75 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19243573 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00591.x | s2cid = 9546342 }} See also [[New Scientist]], April 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Harpegnathos saltator fight.jpg|left|upright|thumb|A worker ''[[Harpegnathos saltator]]'' (a jumping ant) engaged in battle with a rival colony's queen (on top)]]
Ants identify kin and nestmates through their scent, which comes from [[hydrocarbon]]-laced secretions that coat their exoskeletons. If an ant is separated from its original colony, it will eventually lose the colony scent. Any ant that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Henderson G, Andersen JF, Phillips JK, Jeanne RL | title = Internest aggression and identification of possible nestmate discrimination pheromones in polygynous antFormica montana | journal = Journal of Chemical Ecology | volume = 16 | issue = 7 | pages = 2217–28 | date = July 1990 | pmid = 24264088 | doi = 10.1007/BF01026932 | s2cid = 22878651 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parasitic ant species enter the colonies of host ants and establish themselves as social parasites; species such as ''[[Strumigenys xenos]]'' are entirely parasitic and do not have workers, but instead, rely on the food gathered by their ''Strumigenys perplexa'' hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ward PS|year=1996|title=A new workerless social parasite in the ant genus ''Pseudomyrmex'' (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), with a discussion of the origin of social parasitism in ants|journal=[[Systematic Entomology]]|volume= 21|pages=253–263|url=https://archive.org/details/ants_08424|doi=10.1046/j.1365-3113.1996.d01-12.x|issue=3|s2cid=84198690}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Taylor RW|year=1968|title=The Australian workerless inquiline ant, ''Strumigenys xenos'' Brown (Hymenoptera-Formicidae) recorded from New Zealand|journal= New Zealand Entomologist|volume=4|issue=1|pages=47–49|url=https://archive.org/details/ants_10687|doi=10.1080/00779962.1968.9722888|s2cid=83791596 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of parasitism is seen across many ant genera, but the parasitic ant is usually a species that is closely related to its host. A variety of methods are employed to enter the nest of the host ant. A parasitic queen may enter the host nest before the first brood has hatched, establishing herself prior to development of a colony scent. Other species use pheromones to confuse the host ants or to trick them into carrying the parasitic queen into the nest. Some simply fight their way into the nest.&lt;ref name=TheAntParasites&gt;Hölldobler &amp; Wilson (1990), pp. 436–448&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[sexual conflict|conflict between the sexes]] of a species is seen in some species of ants with these reproducers apparently competing to produce offspring that are as closely related to them as possible. The most extreme form involves the production of clonal offspring. An extreme of sexual conflict is seen in ''[[Wasmannia auropunctata]]'', where the queens produce diploid daughters by thelytokous parthenogenesis and males produce clones by a process whereby a diploid egg loses its maternal contribution to produce haploid males who are clones of the father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fournier D, Estoup A, Orivel J, Foucaud J, Jourdan H, Le Breton J, Keller L | title = Clonal reproduction by males and females in the little fire ant | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7046 | pages = 1230–4 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15988525 | doi = 10.1038/nature03705 | bibcode = 2005Natur.435.1230F | s2cid = 1188960 | url = https://serval.unil.ch/resource/serval:BIB_4B6DEB46C264.P001/REF.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships with other organisms===
[[File:Myrmarachne plataleoides female thailand.jpg|thumb|The spider ''[[Myrmarachne plataleoides]]'' (female shown) mimics [[weaver ant]]s to avoid predators.]]
Ants form [[symbiotic]] associations with a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These [[inquiline]]s may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this [[ant mimicry]] (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving [[Batesian mimicry]], where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show [[Wasmannian mimicry]], a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ant-mimicry in Panamanian clubionid and salticid spiders (Araneae: Clubionidae, Salticidae)|author=Reiskind J|journal=Biotropica|volume=9|issue=1|year=1977|pages=1–8|doi=10.2307/2387854|jstor=2387854}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Myrmecomorphy and myrmecophily in spiders: A Review|author=Cushing PE|journal=The Florida Entomologist|volume=80|issue=2|year=1997|pages=165–193|doi=10.2307/3495552|url=http://www.fcla.edu/FlaEnt/fe80p165.pdf|jstor=3495552|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ant Receives Honeydew from Aphid.jpg|thumb|left|An ant collects [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]] from an [[aphid]]]]
[[Aphid]]s and other [[hemiptera]]n insects secrete a sweet liquid called [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]], when they feed on [[plant sap]]. The sugars in honeydew are a high-energy food source, which many ant species collect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Styrsky JD, Eubanks MD | title = Ecological consequences of interactions between ants and honeydew-producing insects | journal = Proceedings.

The ants in turn keep predators away from the aphids and will move them from one feeding location to another. When migrating to a new area, many colonies will take the aphids with them, to ensure a continued supply of honeydew. Ants also tend [[mealybug]]s to harvest their honeydew. Mealybugs may become a serious pest of pineapples if ants are present to protect mealybugs from their natural enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jahn GC, Beardsley JW |year=1996 |title=Effects of ''Pheidole megacephala'' (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) on survival and dispersal of ''Dysmicoccus neobrevipes'' (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae) |journal=[[Journal of Economic Entomology]] |volume=89 |issue=5 |pages=1124–1129|doi=10.1093/jee/89.5.1124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Myrmecophile|Myrmecophilous]] (ant-loving) [[caterpillar]]s of the butterfly family [[Lycaenidae]] (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding areas in the daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night.

A nematode (''Myrmeconema neotropicum'') that infects canopy ants (''[[Cephalotes atratus]]'') causes the black-coloured gasters of workers to turn red. The parasite also alters the behaviour of the ant, causing them to carry their gasters high.

Ants and their larvae are eaten in different parts of the world. The eggs of two species of ants are used in Mexican ''[[escamoles]]''. They are considered a form of insect [[caviar]] and can sell for as much as US$50 per kg going up to US$200 per kg (as of 2006) because they are seasonal and hard to find.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Cruz-Labana |first1=J.

[[File:Monomorium pharaonis.jpg|thumb|The tiny [[pharaoh ant]] is a major pest in hospitals and office blocks; it can make nests between sheets of paper.]]
Some ant species are considered as pests, primarily those that occur in human habitations, where their presence is often problematic. For example, the presence of ants would be undesirable in sterile places such as hospitals or kitchens. Some species or genera commonly categorized as pests include the [[Argentine ant]], [[Tetramorium immigrans|immigrant pavement ant]], [[yellow crazy ant]], [[banded sugar ant]], [[pharaoh ant]], [[Formica rufa|red wood ant]], [[black carpenter ant]], [[Tapinoma sessile|odorous house ant]], [[red imported fire ant]], and [[Myrmica rubra|European fire ant]]. Some ants will raid stored food, some will seek water sources, others may damage indoor structures, some may damage agricultural crops directly or by aiding sucking pests. Some will sting or bite.&lt;ref name=&quot;pests&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7411.html|title=Pest Notes: Ants (Publication 7411)|publisher=University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources|year=2007|access-date=5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adaptive nature of ant colonies make it nearly impossible to eliminate entire colonies and most pest management practices aim to control local populations and tend to be temporary solutions. Ant populations are managed by a combination of approaches that make use of chemical, biological, and physical methods. Chemical methods include the use of insecticidal bait which is gathered by ants as food and brought back to the nest where the poison is inadvertently spread to other colony members through [[trophallaxis]]. Management is based on the species and techniques may vary according to the location and circumstance.&lt;ref name=&quot;pests&quot; /&gt;

Observed by humans since the dawn of history, the behaviour of ants has been documented and the subject of early writings and fables passed from one century to another. Those using scientific methods, [[Myrmecology|myrmecologists]], study ants in the laboratory and in their natural conditions.

The successful techniques used by ant colonies have been studied in computer science and robotics to produce distributed and fault-tolerant systems for solving problems, for example [[Ant colony optimization]] and [[Ant robotics]].

Ant society has always fascinated humans and has been written about both humorously and seriously. [[Mark Twain]] wrote about ants in his 1880 book ''[[A Tramp Abroad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=22 The Black Forest and Its Treasures|title=A Tramp Abroad|last=Twain|first=Mark|name-list-style=vanc|year=1880|chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/119/|isbn=978-0-19-510137-9|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|access-date=2015-12-13|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/trampabroad0000twai_z6u7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern authors have used the example of the ants to comment on the relationship between society and the individual. Examples are [[Robert Frost]] in his poem &quot;Departmental&quot; and [[T. H. White]] in his fantasy novel ''[[The Once and Future King]]''. The plot in French entomologist and writer [[Bernard Werber]]'s ''[[Les Fourmis]]'' science-fiction trilogy is divided between the worlds of ants and humans; ants and their behaviour is described using contemporary scientific knowledge. [[H.G. Wells]] wrote about intelligent ants destroying human settlements in Brazil and threatening human civilization in his 1905 science-fiction short story, ''[[Empire of the Ants|The Empire of the Ants]].'' In more recent times, animated cartoons and 3-D animated films featuring ants have been produced including ''[[Antz]]'', ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', ''[[The Ant Bully (film)|The Ant Bully]]'', ''[[The Ant and the Aardvark]]'', ''[[Ferdy the Ant (TV series)|Ferdy the Ant]]'' and ''[[Atom Ant]].'' Renowned [[Myrmecology|myrmecologist]] [[E. O. Wilson]] wrote a short story, &quot;Trailhead&quot; in 2010 for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine, which describes the life and death of an ant-queen and the rise and fall of her colony, from an ants' point of view.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trailhead&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Wilson, EO|url=http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2010/01/25/100125fi_fiction_wilson?currentPage=all |title=Trailhead|magazine=The New Yorker|date=25 January 2010|pages=56–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French neuroanatomist, psychiatrist and [[Eugenics|eugenicist]] [[Auguste Forel]] believed that ant societies were models for human society. He published a five volume work from 1921 to 1923 that examined ant biology and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Parent A | title = Auguste Forel on ants and neurology | journal = The Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 284–91 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12945958 | doi = 10.1017/s0317167100002754 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, the video game ''[[SimAnt]]'', which simulated an ant colony, won the 1992 [[Software and Information Industry Association#CODiE Awards|Codie award]] for &quot;Best Simulation Program&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siia.net/codies/2009/pw_1992.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611002722/http://www.siia.net/codies/2009/pw_1992.asp |archive-date=2009-06-11 |title= 1992 Excellence in Software Awards Winners |access-date=3 April 2008|publisher=Software &amp; Information Industry Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ants also are quite popular inspiration for many [[science-fiction]] [[insectoid]]s, such as the Formics of ''[[Ender's Game]]'', the Bugs of ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', the giant ants in the films ''[[Them!]]'' and ''[[Empire of the Ants (film)|Empire of the Ants]],'' [[Marvel Comics]]' super hero [[Ant-Man]], and ants mutated into super-intelligence in ''[[Phase IV (1974 film)|Phase IV]]''. In computer [[strategy games]], ant-based species often benefit from increased production rates due to their single-minded focus, such as the Klackons in the ''[[Master of Orion]]'' series of games or the ChCht in ''[[Deadlock II]]''. These characters are often credited with a [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]], a common misconception about ant colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Robots, insects and swarm intelligence|journal=Artificial Intelligence Review|volume=26|issue=4|year=2006|author=Sharkey AJC|doi=10.1007/s10462-007-9057-y|pages=255–268|s2cid=321326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arbitration''', in the context of the [[law of the United States]], is a form of [[alternative dispute resolution]]. Specifically, [[arbitration]] is an alternative to [[litigation]] through which the parties to a dispute agree to submit their respective evidence and legal arguments to a neutral third party (the arbitrator(s) or arbiter(s)) for resolution. In practice arbitration is generally used as a substitute for litigation, particularly when the judicial process is perceived as too slow, expensive or biased. In some contexts, an arbitrator may be described as an '''umpire'''.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{usc|9|5}}, Appointment of arbitrators or umpire&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Agreements to arbitrate were not enforceable at common law. This rule has been traced back to dictum by Lord Coke in ''Vynor’s Case'', 8 Co. Rep. 81b, 77 Eng. Rep. 597 (1609), that agreements to arbitrate were revocable by either party.

During the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[merchants]] became increasingly opposed to this rule. They argued that too many valuable [[business]] relationships were being destroyed through years of expensive [[Adversarial system|adversarial]] [[litigation]], in courts whose rules differed significantly from the informal norms and [[Convention (norm)|convention]]s of businesspeople. Arbitration was promoted as being faster, less adversarial, and cheaper.

The result was the [[New York Arbitration Act]] of 1920, followed by the United States Arbitration Act of 1925 (now known as the [[Federal Arbitration Act]]). Both made agreements to arbitrate valid and enforceable (unless one party could show fraud or unconscionability or some other ground for rescission which undermined the validity of the entire contract). Due to the subsequent judicial expansion of the meaning of [[interstate commerce]], the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] reinterpreted the FAA in a series of cases in the 1980s and 1990s to cover almost the full scope of interstate commerce. In the process, the Court held that the FAA preempted many state laws covering arbitration, some of which had been passed by state [[legislature]]s to protect their [[workers]] and [[consumer]]s against powerful business interestes.

==Types of Arbitration==

===Commercial and other forms of contract arbitration===

Since commercial arbitration is based upon either contract law or the [[law of treaties]], the agreement between the parties to submit their dispute to arbitration is a legally binding [[contract]]. All arbitral decisions are considered to be &quot;final and binding&quot;. This does not, however, void the requirements of law. Any dispute not excluded from arbitration by virtue of law (for example, [[criminal proceedings]]) may be submitted to arbitration.

Furthermore, arbitration agreements can only bind parties who have agreed, expressly or impliedly, to arbitrate, and parties cannot be required to submit to an arbitration process if they have not previously &quot;agreed so to submit&quot;. It is only through the advance agreement of the parties that the arbitrator derives [any] authority to resolve disputes.&lt;ref name=ATTCWA&gt;AT&amp;T Techs, Inc. v [[Communication Workers of America]] (1986), 475 US 643&lt;/ref&gt; Arbitration cannot bind non-signatories to an arbitration contract, even if those non-signatories later become involved with a signatory to a contract by accident (usually through the commission of a [[tort]]).&lt;ref&gt;''County of Contra Costa v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc.'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA4/47CA4t237.htm 47 Cal. App. 4th 237] (1996). [[Kaiser Permanente]] argued in this case, unsuccessfully, that third parties who injure Kaiser members should be forced to arbitrate cross-claims against Kaiser.&lt;/ref&gt; However, third-party non-signatories can be bound by arbitration agreements based on theories of estoppel, agency relationships with a party, assumption of the contract containing the arbitration agreement, third-party beneficiary status under the contract, or piercing the corporate veil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arbitration Procedures and Practice in the United States: Overview: Third Parties |url=https://us.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/0-502-1714?documentSection=co_anchor_a120653 |website=Practical Law |publisher=Thomson Reuters |access-date=11 July 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of whether two parties have actually agreed to arbitrate any disputes is one for judicial determination, because if the parties have not agreed to arbitrate then the arbitrator would have no authority.&lt;ref name=ATTCWA /&gt; Where there is an arbitration agreement, doubts concerning &quot;the ''scope'' of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration&quot;,&lt;ref name=carson&gt;Carson v. Giant Foods, 175 F.3d 325, 329 ([[Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal|4th Circuit]], 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; but issues regarding whether a ''claim'' falls within the scope of arbitrable issues is a judicial matter,&lt;ref&gt;Cara's Notions, Inc. v. Hallmark Cards, 140 F.3d 566, 569 (4th Cir. 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; unless the parties have expressly agreed that the arbitrator may decide the scope of his or her own authority. Most courts hold that general arbitration clauses, such as an agreement to refer to arbitration any dispute &quot;arising from&quot; or &quot;related to&quot; a particular contract, do not authorize an arbitrator to determine whether a particular issue arises from or relates to the contract concerned.&lt;ref name=carson /&gt; A minority view embraced by some courts is that this broad language can evidence the parties' clear and unmistakable intention to delegate the resolution of all issues to the arbitrator, including issues regarding arbitrability.&lt;ref name=benihana&gt;Benihana, Inc. v. Benihana of Tokyo, LLC, 784 F.3d 887, 898 (2d Cir. 2015) (agreement that required arbitration of &quot;any and all&quot; disputes between the parties relating to their agreement constitutes clear and unmistakable evidence of parties' intent for arbitrator to decide arbitrability)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor arbitration===
Arbitration may be used as a means of resolving labor disputes, an alternative to strikes and [[Lockout (industry)|lockouts]]. Labor arbitration comes in two varieties:
#'''interest arbitration''', which provides a method for resolving disputes about the terms to be included in a new contract when the parties are unable to agree, and
#'''grievance arbitration''', which provides a method for resolving disputes over the interpretation and application of a [[collective bargaining agreement]].

Arbitration has also been used as a means of resolving labor disputes for more than a century. Labor organizations in the [[United States]], such as the [[National Labor Union]], called for arbitration as early as 1866 as an alternative to strikes to resolve disputes over the wages, benefits and other rights that workers would enjoy.

====Interest arbitration====
Governments have relied on arbitration to resolve particularly large labor disputes, such as the [[Coal Strike of 1902]]. This type of arbitration, wherein a neutral arbitrator decides the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, is commonly known as interest arbitration. The [[United Steelworkers of America]] adopted an elaborate form of interest arbitration, known as the Experimental Negotiating Agreement, in the 1970s as a means of avoiding the long and costly strikes that had made the industry vulnerable to foreign competition. [[Major League Baseball]] uses a variant of interest arbitration, in which an arbitrator chooses between the two sides' final offers, to set the terms for contracts for players who are not eligible for free agency. Interest arbitration is now most frequently used by public employees who have no right to strike (for example, law enforcement and firefighters).

====Grievance arbitration====
Unions and employers have also employed arbitration to resolve employee and union grievances arising under a collective bargaining agreement. The [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]] made arbitration a central element of the ''Protocol of Peace'' it negotiated with garment manufacturers in the second decade of the twentieth century. Grievance arbitration became even more popular during [[World War II]], when most unions had adopted a no-strike pledge. The [[National War Labor Board (1942–1945)|War Labor Board]], which attempted to mediate disputes over contract terms, pressed for inclusion of grievance arbitration in collective bargaining agreements. The Supreme Court subsequently made labor arbitration a key aspect of federal labor policy in three cases which came to be known as the Steelworkers' Trilogy. The Court held that grievance arbitration was a preferred dispute resolution technique and that courts could not overturn arbitrators' awards unless the award does not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. State and federal statutes may allow vacating an award on narrow grounds (''e.g.'', fraud). These protections for arbitrator awards are premised on the union-management system, which provides both parties with due process. Due process in this context means that both parties have experienced representation throughout the process, and that the arbitrators practice only as neutrals. ''See'' [[National Academy of Arbitrators]].

===Securities arbitration===
In the United States securities industry, arbitration has long been the preferred method of resolving disputes between brokerage firms, and between firms and their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Resolving Investment Disputes by Arbitration|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/securities_law/securities_arbitration.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|access-date=22 March 2018|date=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arbitration process operates under its own rules, as defined by contract. Securities arbitrations are held primarily by the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]].

The securities industry uses pre-dispute arbitration agreements, through which the parties agree to arbitrate their disputes before any such dispute arises. Those agreements were upheld by the United States Supreme Court in Shearson v. MacMahon, 482 U.S. 220 (1987) and today nearly all disputes involving brokerage firms, other than Securities class action claims,&lt;ref name=&quot;complinet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finra.complinet.com/en/display/display.html?rbid=2403&amp;record_id=1901&amp;element_id=1660|publisher=finra.complinet.com|title=FINRA Manual - Notices - 1992 - 92-65 SEC Approval of Amendments Concerning the Exclusion of Class-Action Matters From Arbitration Proceedings and Requiring That Predispute Arbitration Agreements Include a Notice That Class-Action Matters May Not Be Arbitrated|access-date=2017-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094321/http://finra.complinet.com/en/display/display.html?rbid=2403&amp;record_id=1901&amp;element_id=1660|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; are resolved in arbitration.

The SEC has come under fire from members of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] for not fulfilling statutory duty to protect individual investors, because all brokers require arbitration, and arbitration does not provide a court-supervised discovery process, require arbitrators to follow rules of evidence or result in written opinions establishing precedence, or case law, or provide the efficiency gains it once did. Arbitrator selection bias, hidden conflicts of interest, and a case where an arbitration panel refused to follow instructions handed down from a judge, were also raised as issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgenson2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morgenson|first1=Gretchen|title=Dear S.E.C., Reconsider Arbitration - The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/business/yourmoney/06gret.html|access-date=22 March 2018|agency=New York Times|date=6 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial arbitration===
Some state court systems have promulgated court-ordered arbitration; family law (particularly child custody) is the most prominent example. Judicial arbitration is often merely advisory dispute resolution technique, serving as the first step toward resolution, but not binding either side and allowing for trial [[Trial_de_novo|de novo]]. Litigation attorneys present their side of the case to an independent tertiary lawyer, who issues an opinion on settlement. Should the parties in question decide to continue to dispute resolution process, there can be some sanctions imposed from the initial arbitration per terms of the contract.

==Validity of arbitration clauses==

Although properly drafted arbitration clauses are generally valid, they are subject to challenge in court for compliance with laws and public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to Arbitration in New York|url=http://eguides.cmslegal.com/pdf/arbitration_volume_I/CMS%20GtA_Vol%20I_NEW%20YORK.pdf|publisher=CMS Legal|access-date=2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arbitration clauses may potentially be challenged as unconscionable and, therefore, unenforceable.&lt;ref name=&quot;huffingtonpost&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brad-reid/unconscionable-employment_b_4234686.html|work=huffingtonpost.com|title=Unconscionable Employment Arbitration Agreement Held Unenforceable &amp;#124; The Huffington Post|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, the validity of an arbitration clause is decided by a court rather than an arbitrator. However, if the validity of the entire arbitration agreement is in dispute, then the issue is decided by the arbitrators in the first instance. This is known as the principle of separability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arbitration Procedures and Practice in the United States: Overview: Separability |url=https://us.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/0-502-1714?documentSection=co_anchor_a849784 |website=Practical Law |publisher=Thomson Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that &quot;under the [[Federal Arbitration Act|FAA]], where an agreement to arbitrate includes an agreement that the arbitrator will determine the enforceability of the agreement, if a party challenges specifically the enforceability of that particular agreement, the district court considers the challenge, but if a party challenges the enforceability of the agreement as a whole, the challenge is for the arbitrator.&quot;&lt;ref name=SCOTUSRenter-A-Center&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/09-497.pdf Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson]. Supreme Court of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the law typically allows federal courts to decide these types of &quot;gateway&quot; or validity questions, but the Supreme Court ruled that since Jackson targeted the entire contract rather than a specific clause, the arbitrator decided the validity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law360.com/articles/176273 High Court Favors Arbitrator In Rent-A-Center Case]. Law360.com.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public Citizen]], an advocacy organization opposed to the enforcement of pre-dispute arbitration agreements, characterized the decision negatively: &quot;the court said that companies can write their contracts so that the companies' own arbitrator decides whether it's fair to submit a case to that arbitrator.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizen.org/pressroom/pressroomredirect.cfm?ID=3346|title=Congress Must Undo Damage of U.S. Supreme Court's Latest Anti-Consumer Decision|date=May 17, 2011|access-date=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[insurance]] law, arbitration is complicated by the fact that insurance is regulated at the state level under the [[McCarran–Ferguson Act]]. From a federal perspective, however, a circuit court ruling has determined that McCarran-Ferguson requires a state statute rather than administrative interpretations.&lt;ref name=WenzelKA/&gt; The Missouri Department of Insurance attempted to block a binding arbitration agreement under its state authority, but since this action was based only on a policy of the department and not on a state statute, the [[United States district court]] found that the Department of Insurance did not have the authority to invalidate the arbitration agreement.&lt;ref name=WenzelKA&gt;Wenzel KA. (2004). [http://www.forc.org/public/journals/9#57 THE VALIDITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS IN INSURANCE POLICIES] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726062059/http://www.forc.org/public/journals/9#57 |date=2011-07-26 }}. ''FORC Journal'' 15(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[AT&amp;T Mobility v. Concepcion]]'' (2011), the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] upheld an arbitration clause in a consumer [[standard form contract]] which waived the right to a [[lawsuit]] and [[class action]].&lt;ref name=Horton2012&gt;Horton D. (2012). [https://ssrn.com/abstract=2158882 Federal Arbitration Act Preemption, Purposivism, and State Public Policy]. Forthcoming in ''Georgetown Law Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this clause was relatively generous in that the business paid all fees unless the action was determined to be frivolous and a [[small-claims court]] action remained available; these types of protections are recommended for the contract to remain enforceable and not [[unconscionable]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/litigation/materials/sac_2012/04-_runaway_arbitration.authcheckdam.pdf Preventing the Runaway Arbitration: Practical Strategies and Solutions]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ABA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proceedings==
Various bodies of rules have been developed that can be used for arbitration proceedings. The rules to be followed by the arbitrator are specified by the agreement establishing the arbitration.

=== Enforcement of award ===
{{Main|Arbitration award}}

In some cases, a party may comply with an award voluntarily. However, in other cases a party will have to petition to receive a court judgment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://corporate.findlaw.com/litigation-disputes/the-basics-of-confirming-vacating-modifying-and-correcting-an.html/|title=The Basics of Confirming, Vacating, Modifying and Correcting an Arbitration Award Under the Federal Arbitration Act and the Texas Arbitration Act - FindLaw|website=Findlaw|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ware|first=Stephen J.|date=2001-03-21|title=Paying the Price of Process: Judicial Regulation of Consumer Arbitration Agreements|ssrn=264122|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network|hdl=1808/7369}}&lt;/ref&gt; for enforcement through various means such as a [[writ of execution]], [[garnishment]], or [[lien]]. If the property is in another state, then a sister-state judgment (relying on the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]]) can be received by filing to enforce the judgment in the state where the property is located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reynolds |first1=William L. |title=The Iron Law of Full Faith and Credit |journal=Maryland Law Review |date=1994 |page=746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vacatur===
Under the [[Federal Arbitration Act]], courts can only vacate awards for limited reasons&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260387685|title=State regulation of arbitration proceedings: judicial review of Arbitration Awards by State Courts|website=ResearchGate|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; set out in statute&lt;ref&gt;9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(1)&lt;/ref&gt; with similar language in the state model [[Uniform Arbitration Act]].

The court will generally not change the arbitrator's findings of fact but will decide only whether the arbitrator was guilty of malfeasance, or whether the arbitrator exceeded the limits of his or her authority in the arbitral award or whether the award was made in manifest disregard of law or conflicts with well-established public policy.

==Arbitrators==
Arbitrators have wide latitude in crafting remedies in the arbitral decision, with the only real limitation being that they may not exceed the limits of their authority in their award. An example of exceeding arbitral authority might be awarding relief not requested by the parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Matter of 544 Bloomrest, LLC v. Harding, 2022 NY Slip Op 00936 (1st Dep't Feb. 10, 2022) |url=https://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2022/2022_00936.htm |publisher=New York State Law Reporting Bureau |access-date=12 February 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is open to the parties to restrict the possible awards that the arbitrator can make. If this restriction requires a straight choice between the position of one party or the position of the other, then it is known as ''[[pendulum arbitration]]'' or ''final offer arbitration''. It is designed to encourage the parties to moderate their initial positions so as to make it more likely they receive a favorable decision.

No definitive statement can be made concerning the credentials or experience levels of arbitrators, although some jurisdictions have elected to establish standards for arbitrators in certain fields. Some independent organizations, such as the [[American Arbitration Association]] offer arbitrator training programs, and arbitrators may cite their completion of that training as a credential. Generally speaking, however, the credibility of an arbitrator rests upon reputation, experience level in arbitrating particular issues, or expertise/experience in a particular field. Arbitrators are generally not required to be members of the legal profession.

To ensure effective arbitration and to increase the general credibility of the arbitral process, arbitrators will sometimes sit as a panel, usually consisting of three arbitrators. Often the three consist of an expert in the legal area within which the dispute falls (such as contract law in the case of a dispute over the terms and conditions of a contract), an expert in the industry within which the dispute falls (such as the construction industry, in the case of a dispute between a homeowner and his general contractor), and an experienced arbitrator.

==Arbitration on television==
The &quot;[[Court show|judge shows]]&quot; that have become popular in many countries, especially the [[United States]], are actually binding arbitration. ''[[The People's Court]]'' and [[Judge Judy]] are notable examples.

'''Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KBE|size=100%}} (13 August 1899&amp;nbsp;– 29 April 1980) was an English&lt;!--as per [[MOS:BIO]]; In addition to notability, self identification; &quot;I'm English&quot;: Hitchcock in a 1963 interview with Fallaci; see http://scrapsfromtheloft.com/2016/06/14/fallaci-hitchcock-interview/--&gt; filmmaker widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of cinema.&lt;ref name=&quot;influential&quot; /&gt; In a career spanning six decades, he directed over 50 feature films,{{efn|According to Gene Adair (2002), Hitchcock made 53 feature films.{{sfn|Adair|2002|p=9}} According to [[Roger Ebert]] in 1980, it was 54.&lt;ref name=Ebert1May1980&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger|author-link=Roger Ebert |title=The Master of Suspense is Dead |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/the-master-of-suspense-is-dead |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=1 May 1980 |access-date=26 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226235234/https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/the-master-of-suspense-is-dead|archive-date=26 December 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} many of which are still widely watched and studied today. Known as the &quot;Master of Suspense&quot;, he became as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews, [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|his cameo roles]] in most of his films, and his hosting and producing the television anthology ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' (1955–65). His films garnered 46 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including six wins, although he never won the award for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] despite five nominations.

Hitchcock initially trained as a technical clerk and copy writer before entering the film industry in 1919 as a [[Intertitle|title card]] designer. His directorial debut was the British-German silent film ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' (1925). His first successful film, ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]'' (1927), helped to shape the [[Thriller film|thriller]] genre, and ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'' (1929) was the first British &quot;[[Sound film#Transition: Europe|talkie]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Blackmail/&gt; His thrillers ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935) and ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938) are ranked among the [[BFI Top 100 British films|greatest British films]] of the 20th century. By 1939, he had international recognition and producer [[David O. Selznick]] persuaded him to move to Hollywood.

The &quot;[[Hitchcockian]]&quot; style includes the use of editing and camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into [[voyeurism|voyeurs]], and framing [[Shot (filmmaking)|shots]] to maximise anxiety and fear. The film critic [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film &quot;is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole.&quot;{{sfn|Wood|2002|p=62}}  Hitchcock made multiple films with some of the biggest stars in Hollywood, including four with [[Cary Grant]] in the 1940s and 1950s, three with [[Ingrid Bergman]] in the last half of the 1940s, four with [[James Stewart]] over a ten-year span commencing in 1948, and three with [[Grace Kelly]] in the mid-1950s. Hitchcock became an American citizen in 1955.

Hitchcock was born on 13 August 1899 in the flat above his parents' leased grocer's shop at 517 High Road, [[Leytonstone]], on the outskirts of [[East London]] (then part of [[Essex]]), the youngest of three children: William Daniel (1890–1943), Ellen Kathleen (&quot;Nellie&quot;) (1892–1979), and Alfred Joseph (1899–1980). His parents, Emma Jane Hitchcock ({{née}} Whelan; 1863–1942), and William Edgar Hitchcock (1862–1914), were both [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], with partial roots in Ireland;{{sfn|Adair|2002|pp=11–12}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irishecho.com/2011/02/st-patricks-day-2005-the-master-of-suspense-2/ |title=St. Patrick's Day 2005: The Master of Suspense |work=Irish Echo |date=17 February 2011 |access-date=14 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215023358/https://www.irishecho.com/2011/02/st-patricks-day-2005-the-master-of-suspense-2/|archive-date=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a greengrocer, as his grandfather had been.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1996|pp=21–22}}; {{harvnb|Spoto|1999|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a large extended family, including uncle John Hitchcock with his five-bedroom Victorian house on Campion Road, [[Putney]], complete with maid, cook, chauffeur and gardener. Every summer, his uncle rented a seaside house for the family in [[Cliftonville]], Kent. Hitchcock said that he first became class-conscious there, noticing the differences between tourists and locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing himself as a well-behaved boy—his father called him his &quot;little lamb without a spot&quot;—Hitchcock said he could not remember ever having had a playmate.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=25}} One of his favourite stories for interviewers was about his father sending him to the local police station with a note when he was five; the policeman looked at the note and locked him in a cell for a few minutes, saying, &quot;This is what we do to naughty boys.&quot; The experience left him, he said, with a lifelong fear of policemen; in 1973 he told [[Tom Snyder]] that he was &quot;scared stiff of anything&amp;nbsp;... to do with the law&quot; and wouldn't even drive a car in case he got a parking ticket.&lt;ref&gt;For the police story: {{harvnb|Truffaut|1983|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Taylor|1996|p=25}}; [[Dick Cavett|Cavett, Dick]] (8 June 1972). &quot;Interview with Alfred Hitchcock&quot;, ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', ABC, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYTx6N24tHk&amp;t=6m52s 00:06:52] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225115833/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYTx6N24tHk&amp;t=6m52s |date=25 December 2019 }}.{{pb}}

When he was six, the family moved to [[Limehouse]] and leased two stores at 130 and 175 Salmon Lane, which they ran as a [[fish and chips|fish-and-chips]] shop and fishmongers' respectively; they lived above the former.&lt;ref name=McG2003p13&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock attended his first school, the Howrah House Convent in [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], which he entered in 1907, at age 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spoto|1999|pp=20, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to biographer [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], he stayed at Howrah House for at most two years. He also attended a convent school, the Wode Street School &quot;for the daughters of gentlemen and little boys&quot;, run by the [[Faithful Companions of Jesus]].

While biographer Gene Adair reports that Hitchcock was &quot;an average, or slightly above-average, pupil&quot;,{{sfn|Adair|2002|p=15}} Hitchcock said that he was &quot;usually among the four or five at the top of the class&quot;;{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=26}} at the end of his first year, his work in Latin, English, French and [[religious education]] was noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adair|2002|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Truffaut|1983|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He told [[Peter Bogdanovich]]: &quot;The Jesuits taught me organisation, control and, to some degree, analysis.&quot;{{sfn|Adair|2002|p=15}}&lt;!--replace source--&gt;

His favourite subject was [[geography]], and he became interested in maps, and railway, tram and bus timetables; according to [[John Russell Taylor]], he could recite all the stops on the [[Orient Express]].{{sfn|Taylor|1996|p=31}} He also had a particular interest in [[Trams in London|London trams]]. An overwhelming majority of his films include rail or tram scenes, in particular ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'', ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' and ''[[Number Seventeen]]''. A [[clapperboard]] shows the number of the scene and the number of takes, and Hitchcock would often take the two numbers on the clapperboard and whisper the London tram route names. For example, if the clapperboard showed Scene 23; Take 3; Hitchcock would whisper &quot;Woodford, Hampstead&quot; – Woodford being the terminus of the route 23 tram, and Hampstead the end of route 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://writebetter.io/examples/film+rail/extended/ |title=How to use &quot;film rail&quot; in a sentence - WriteBetter |access-date=7 November 2021 |archive-date=7 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211107064550/https://writebetter.io/examples/film+rail/extended/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=November 2021}}

Hitchcock was too young to enlist when the [[First World War]] started in July 1914, and when he reached the required age of 18 in 1917, he received a C3 classification (&quot;free from serious organic disease, able to stand service conditions in garrisons at home&amp;nbsp;... only suitable for sedentary work&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1996|pp=27–28}};&lt;!--check page--&gt; [https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1918-06-20/debates/3ec12ba9-4d13-4c03-880a-226006f28d83/MilitaryService(MedicalGrading) &quot;Military service (medical grading&quot;)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224062439/https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1918-06-20/debates/3ec12ba9-4d13-4c03-880a-226006f28d83/MilitaryService(MedicalGrading) |date=24 February 2019 }}, ''Hansard'', vol. 107, 20 June 1918, 607–642.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined a cadet regiment of the [[Royal Engineers]] and took part in theoretical briefings, weekend drills, and exercises.

After the war, Hitchcock took an interest in creative writing.

He said: &quot;It was the first film that I had really got my hands onto.&quot;{{sfn|Spoto|2008|pp=3–4}} The editor and &quot;script girl&quot; on ''Woman to Woman'' was [[Alma Reville]], his future wife. He also worked as an assistant to Cutts on ''[[The White Shadow (film)|The White Shadow]]'' (1924), ''[[The Passionate Adventure]]'' (1924), ''[[The Blackguard]]'' (1925), and ''[[The Prude's Fall]]'' (1925).{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=30}} ''The Blackguard'' was produced at the [[Babelsberg Studios]] in Potsdam, where Hitchcock watched part of the making of F. W. Murnau's film ''The Last Laugh'' (1924).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gottlieb|2002|p=42}}; {{harvnb|Gottlieb|2003|pp=157–158}}; also see {{harvnb|Garncarz|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was impressed with Murnau's work and later used many of his techniques for the set design in his own productions.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2002|pp=42–43}}

In the summer of 1925, Balcon asked Hitchcock to direct ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' (1925), starring [[Virginia Valli]], a co-production of Gainsborough and the German firm [[Emelka]] at the [[Bavaria Studios|Geiselgasteig studio]] near Munich. Reville, by then Hitchcock's fiancée, was assistant director-editor.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|pp=31, 36}}{{sfn|Spoto|1992|p=3}} Although the film was a commercial flop,{{sfn|McGilligan|2003|pp=68–71}} Balcon liked Hitchcock's work; a ''Daily Express'' headline called him the &quot;Young man with a master mind&quot;.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=39}} Production of ''The Pleasure Garden'' encountered obstacles which Hitchcock would later learn from: on arrival to [[Brenner Pass]], he failed to declare his [[film stock]] to customs and it was confiscated; one actress could not enter the water for a scene because she was on her [[Menstrual cycle|period]]; budget overruns meant that he had to borrow money from the actors.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=70}} Hitchcock also needed a translator to give instructions to the cast and crew.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=70}}

In Germany, Hitchcock observed the nuances of [[Cinema of Germany|German cinema]] and filmmaking which had a big influence on him.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=63}} When he was not working, he would visit Berlin's art galleries, concerts and museums. He would also meet with actors, writers, and producers to build connections.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=64}} Balcon asked him to direct a second film in Munich, ''[[The Mountain Eagle]]'' (1926), based on an original story titled ''Fear o' God''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-the-mountain-eagle-1926 |title=Alfred Hitchcock Collectors' Guide: The Mountain Eagle (1926) |publisher=Brenton Film |access-date=30 August 2019 |date=23 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219011242/https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-the-mountain-eagle-1926|archive-date=19 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is lost, and Hitchcock called it &quot;a very bad movie&quot;.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=39}}{{sfn|Spoto|1992|p=5}} A year later, Hitchcock wrote and directed ''[[The Ring (1927 film)|The Ring]]''; although the screenplay was credited solely to his name, [[Eliot Stannard|Elliot Stannard]] assisted him with the writing.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=98}} ''The Ring'' garnered positive reviews; the ''Bioscope'' magazine critic called it &quot;the most magnificent British film ever made&quot;.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=76}}

When he returned to England, Hitchcock was one of the early members of the London Film Society, newly formed in 1925.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=75}} Through the Society, he became fascinated by the work by Soviet filmmakers: [[Dziga Vertov]], [[Lev Kuleshov]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]]. He would also socialise with fellow English filmmakers [[Ivor Montagu]] and [[Adrian Brunel]], and [[Walter C. Mycroft]].{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=76}}

Hitchcock established himself as a name director with his first thriller, ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]'' (1927).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lodger BFI&quot;/&gt; The film concerns the hunt for a [[Jack the Ripper]]-style serial killer who, wearing a black cloak and carrying a black bag, is murdering young blonde women in London, and only on Tuesdays.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=45}} A landlady suspects that her lodger is the killer, but he turns out to be innocent. To convey the impression footsteps were being heard from an upper floor, Hitchcock had a glass floor made so that the viewer could see the lodger pacing up and down in his room above the landlady.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=47}} Hitchcock had wanted the leading man to be guilty, or for the film at least to end ambiguously, but the star was [[Ivor Novello]], a [[matinée idol]], and the &quot;[[star system (filmmaking)|star system]]&quot; meant that Novello could not be the villain. Hitchcock told Truffaut: &quot;You have to clearly spell it out in big letters: 'He is innocent.'&quot; (He had the same problem years later with [[Cary Grant]] in ''[[#Suspicion|Suspicion]]'' (1941).){{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=43}} Released in January 1927, ''The Lodger'' was a commercial and critical success in the UK.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=85}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kapsis|1992|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its release the trade journal ''Bioscope'' wrote: &quot;It is possible that this film is the finest British production ever made&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lodger BFI&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Lodger, The: A Story of the London Fog (1926) |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/438120/index.html |access-date=13 July 2022 |work=BFI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock told Truffaut that the film was the first of his to be influenced by [[German Expressionism]]: &quot;In truth, you might almost say that ''The Lodger'' was my first picture.&quot;{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=44}}&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 edition; is the date correct? --&gt; He made his first [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|cameo appearance]] in the film, sitting in a newsroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-the-lodger-a-story-of-the-london-fog-1926 |title=Alfred Hitchcock Collectors' Guide: The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1926) |publisher=Brenton Film |access-date=30 August 2019 |date=23 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191222033129/https://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/alfred-hitchcock-collectors-guide-the-lodger-a-story-of-the-london-fog-1926|archive-date=22 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=49}}

====Marriage====
[[File:Hitch Gets Hitched.jpg|thumb|The Hitchcocks on their wedding day, [[Brompton Oratory]], 2 December 1926]]
On 2 December 1926, Hitchcock married the English screenwriter [[Alma Reville]] at the [[Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary|Brompton Oratory]] in [[South Kensington]].{{sfn|Spoto|1999|p=5}} The couple honeymooned in Paris, [[Lake Como]] and St. Moritz, before returning to London to live in a leased flat on the top two floors of 153 [[Cromwell Road]], Kensington.{{sfn|McGilligan|2003|pp=89–90}} Reville, who was born just hours after Hitchcock,{{sfn|Hitchcock|Bouzereau|2003|p=15}} converted from Protestantism to Catholicism, apparently at the insistence of Hitchcock's mother; she was baptised on 31 May 1927 and confirmed at [[Westminster Cathedral]] by Cardinal [[Francis Bourne]] on 5 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hitchcock|Bouzereau|2003|p=48}}; {{harvnb|Spoto|1999|pp=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, when they learned that Reville was pregnant, the Hitchcocks purchased &quot;Winter's Grace&quot;, a [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] farmhouse set in 11 acres on Stroud Lane, [[Wonersh#Shamley Green|Shamley Green]], Surrey, for £2,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spoto|1999|p=115}}; {{harvnb|Hitchcock|Bouzereau|2003|p=55}}; {{cite news |last1=Clark |first1=Ross |title=Alfred Hitchcock: A long way from the Bates Motel |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/period-property/3360983/Alfred-Hitchcock-A-long-way-from-the-Bates-Motel.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=13 April 2008|access-date=5 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227193225/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/period-property/3360983/Alfred-Hitchcock-A-long-way-from-the-Bates-Motel.html|archive-date=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter and only child, [[Patricia Hitchcock|Patricia Alma Hitchcock]], was born on 7 July that year.{{sfn|Hitchcock|Bouzereau|2003|pp=59–60}} Patricia died on 9 August 2021 at 93.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barnes |first1=Mike |title=Pat Hitchcock, 'Strangers on a Train' Actress and Daughter of Alfred Hitchcock, Dies at 93 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/pat-hitchcock-dead-alfred-daughter-1234995917/ |website=The Hollywood Reporter |date=10 August 2021 |access-date=11 August 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reville became her husband's closest collaborator; [[Charles Champlin]] wrote in 1982: &quot;The Hitchcock touch had four hands, and two were Alma's.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Champlin |first1=Charles|author-link=Charles Champlin |title=Alma Reville Hitchcock, The Unsung Partner |work=Los Angeles Times |date=29 July 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Hitchcock accepted the [[AFI Life Achievement Award]] in 1979, he said that he wanted to mention &quot;four people who have given me the most affection, appreciation and encouragement, and constant collaboration. The first of the four is a film editor, the second is a scriptwriter, the third is the mother of my daughter, Pat, and the fourth is as fine a cook as ever performed miracles in a domestic kitchen. And their names are Alma Reville.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb5VdGCQFOM&amp;t=3m14s &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Accepts the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1979&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200615235350/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb5VdGCQFOM&amp;t=3m14s |date=15 June 2020 }}, American Film Institute, 16 April 2009, 00:03:14.&lt;/ref&gt; Reville wrote or co-wrote on many of Hitchcock's films, including ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'', [[Suspicion (1941 film)|''Suspicion'']] and [[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|''The 39 Steps'']].

In 1933, Hitchcock signed a multi-film contract with [[Gaumont-British]], once again working for Michael Balcon.{{Sfn|Spoto|1999|p=37}}{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=153}} His first film for the company, ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1934), was a success; his second, ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935), was acclaimed in the UK and gained him recognition in the United States. It also established the quintessential English &quot;Hitchcock blonde&quot; ([[Madeleine Carroll]]) as the template for his succession of ice-cold, elegant leading ladies. Screenwriter [[Robert Towne]] remarked, &quot;It's not much of an exaggeration to say that all contemporary escapist entertainment begins with ''The 39 Steps''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Scragow |first1=Michael |title=Rewatching Hitchcock's &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/rewatching-hitchcocks-the-39-steps |magazine=The New Yorker |date=9 July 2012|access-date=25 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026110604/https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/rewatching-hitchcocks-the-39-steps|archive-date=26 October 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This film was one of the first to introduce the &quot;[[MacGuffin]]&quot; plot device, a term coined by the English screenwriter [[Angus MacPhail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McArthur |first=Colin |title=Whisky Galore! and the Maggie |year=2003 |publisher=I.B.

[[File:Hitchcocks-Joan-Harrison-1937.jpg|thumb|[[Alma Reville]], [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], Hitchcock, and [[Patricia Hitchcock]], 24 August 1937]]

Hitchcock released two spy thrillers in 1936. ''[[Sabotage (1936 film)|Sabotage]]'' was loosely based on [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novel, ''[[The Secret Agent]]'' (1907), about a woman who discovers that her husband is a terrorist, and ''[[Secret Agent (1936 film)|Secret Agent]]'', based on two stories in ''[[Ashenden: Or the British Agent]]'' (1928) by [[W. Somerset Maugham]].{{efn|In 2017, a ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine poll ranked ''Sabotage'' as the 44th best British film ever.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Out&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/100-best-british-films#tab_panel_4 |title=The 100 best British films |magazine=Time Out |access-date=24 October 2017 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190403073405/https://www.timeout.com/london/film/100-best-british-films%23tab_panel_4|archive-date=3 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At this time, Hitchcock also became notorious for pranks against the cast and crew. These jokes ranged from simple and innocent to crazy and maniacal. For instance, he hosted a dinner party where he dyed all the food blue because he claimed there weren't enough blue foods. He also had a horse delivered to the dressing room of his friend, actor [[Gerald du Maurier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/29/alfred-hitchcock-a-sadistic-prankster/ |title=Alfred Hitchcock: a sadistic prankster |last=Chilton |first=Martin |date=29 April 2016 |work=The Telegraph |access-date=9 January 2019 |issn=0307-1235|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110014406/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/29/alfred-hitchcock-a-sadistic-prankster/|archive-date=10 January 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock followed up with ''[[Young and Innocent]]'' in 1937, a crime thriller based on the 1936 novel ''[[A Shilling for Candles]]'' by [[Josephine Tey]].{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=137}} Starring [[Nova Pilbeam]] and [[Derrick De Marney]], the film was relatively enjoyable for the cast and crew to make.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=137}} To meet distribution purposes in America, the film's runtime was cut and this included removal of one of Hitchcock's favourite scenes: a children's tea party which becomes menacing to the protagonists.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=138}}

Hitchcock's next major success was ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938), &quot;one of the greatest train movies from the genre's golden era&quot;, according to [[Philip French]], in which Miss Froy ([[May Whitty]]), a British spy posing as a governess, disappears on a train journey through the fictional European country of Bandrika.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Philip |last=French |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jul/24/my-favourite-hitchcock-lady-vanishes |title=My favourite Hitchcock: The Lady Vanishes |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 July 2012|access-date=10 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209074800/https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jul/24/my-favourite-hitchcock-lady-vanishes|archive-date=9 February 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film saw Hitchcock receive the [[1938 New York Film Critics Circle Awards|1938 New York Film Critics Circle Award]] for Best Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Lady Vanishes |work=Turner Classic Movies |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/80706/The-Lady-Vanishes/ |access-date=24 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711175302/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/80706/The-Lady-Vanishes/ |archive-date=11 July 2017 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin Crisler of the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' wrote in June 1938: &quot;Three unique and valuable institutions the British have that we in America have not: [[Magna Carta]], the [[Tower Bridge]] and Alfred Hitchcock, the greatest director of screen melodramas in the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Crisler |first1=B.

By 1938 Hitchcock was aware that he had reached his peak in Britain.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=140}} He had received numerous offers from producers in the United States, but he turned them all down because he disliked the contractual obligations or thought the projects were repellent.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=141}} However, producer [[David O. Selznick]] offered him a concrete proposal to make a film based on the sinking of {{RMS|Titanic}}, which was eventually shelved, but Selznick persuaded Hitchcock to come to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]]. In July 1938, Hitchcock flew to New York, and found that he was already a celebrity; he was featured in magazines and gave interviews to radio stations.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=142}} In Hollywood, Hitchcock met Selznick for the first time. Selznick offered him a four-film contract, approximately $40,000 for each picture ({{Inflation|US|40,000|1938|fmt=eq|r=-4}}).{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=142}}

===Early Hollywood years: 1939–1945===
====Selznick contract====
Selznick signed Hitchcock to a seven-year contract beginning in April 1939,{{Sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=121}} and the Hitchcocks moved to Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leff|1999|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hitchcocks lived in a spacious flat on [[Wilshire Boulevard]], and slowly acclimatised themselves to the Los Angeles area. He and his wife Alma kept a low profile, and were not interested in attending parties or being celebrities.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=153}} Hitchcock discovered his taste for fine food in West Hollywood, but still carried on his way of life from England.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=154}} He was impressed with Hollywood's filmmaking culture, expansive budgets and efficiency,{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=154}} compared to the limits that he had often faced in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leff|1999|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June that year, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine called him the &quot;greatest master of melodrama in screen history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |date=19 June 1939 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=b0kEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66 66] |title=Alfred Hitchcock: England's Best Director starts work in Hollywood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hitchcock and Selznick respected each other, their working arrangements were sometimes difficult. Selznick suffered from constant financial problems, and Hitchcock was often unhappy about Selznick's creative control and interference over his films. Selznick was also displeased with Hitchcock's method of shooting just what was in the script, and nothing more, which meant that the film could not be cut and remade differently at a later time.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=152}} As well as complaining about Hitchcock's &quot;goddamn jigsaw cutting&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|pp= 251–252}}&lt;/ref&gt; their personalities were mismatched: Hitchcock was reserved whereas Selznick was flamboyant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Billheimer|first=John|chapter=Hitchcock and Selznick|date=1 May 2019|chapter-url=http://kentucky.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.5810/kentucky/9780813177427.001.0001/upso-9780813177427-chapter-006|title=Hitchcock and the Censors|pages=59–63|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|doi=10.5810/kentucky/9780813177427.003.0006|isbn=978-0-8131-7742-7|s2cid=213530256|access-date=21 November 2020|archive-date=29 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201129082758/https://kentucky.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.5810/kentucky/9780813177427.001.0001/upso-9780813177427-chapter-006|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Selznick generously lent Hitchcock to the larger film studios.{{Sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=145}} Selznick made only a few films each year, as did fellow independent producer [[Samuel Goldwyn]], so he did not always have projects for Hitchcock to direct. Goldwyn had also negotiated with Hitchcock on a possible contract, only to be outbid by Selznick. In a later interview, Hitchcock said: &quot;[Selznick] was the Big Producer.&amp;nbsp;... Producer was king. The most flattering thing Mr. Selznick ever said about me—and it shows you the amount of control—he said I was the 'only director' he'd 'trust with a film'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gottlieb|2003|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rebecca (1940) - Trailer.webm|thumb|Trailer for ''Rebecca'' (1940)]]

Hitchcock approached American cinema cautiously; his first American film was set in England in which the &quot;Americanness&quot; of the characters was incidental:{{Sfn|Wood|2002|p=240}} ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940) was set in a Hollywood version of England's Cornwall and based on a novel by English novelist [[Daphne du Maurier]]. Selznick insisted on a faithful adaptation of the book, and disagreed with Hitchcock with the use of humour.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=150}}{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=155}} The film, starring [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Joan Fontaine]], concerns an unnamed naïve young woman who marries a widowed aristocrat. She lives in his large [[English country house]], and struggles with the lingering reputation of his elegant and worldly first wife Rebecca, who died under mysterious circumstances. The film won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] at the [[13th Academy Awards]]; the statuette was given to producer Selznick. Hitchcock received his first nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], his first of five such nominations.&lt;ref name=Rebecca&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1941 |title=The 13th Academy Awards, 1941 |access-date=30 December 2017 |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303110034/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/13th-winners.html|archive-date=3 March 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duncan|2003|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock's second American film was the thriller ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' (1940), set in Europe, based on [[Vincent Sheean]]'s book ''Personal History'' (1935) and produced by [[Walter Wanger]]. It was nominated for Best Picture that year. Hitchcock felt uneasy living and working in Hollywood while Britain was at [[World War II|war]]; his concern resulted in a film that overtly supported the British war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duncan|2003|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filmed in 1939, it was inspired by the rapidly changing events in Europe, as covered by an American newspaper reporter played by [[Joel McCrea]]. By mixing footage of European scenes with scenes filmed on a Hollywood [[backlot]], the film avoided direct references to [[Nazism]], [[Nazi Germany]], and Germans, to comply with the [[Motion Picture Production Code]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2017}}

====Early war years====
In September 1940 the Hitchcocks bought the {{convert|200|acre|km2|adj=on}} Cornwall Ranch near [[Scotts Valley]], California, in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.scottsvalleychamber.com/history/history/hitchcock.htm |title=Alfred Hitchcock Found Contentment in SV |first=Marion |last=Pokriots |publisher=Scotts Valley Historical Society |access-date=31 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190101100444/http://history.scottsvalleychamber.com/history/history/hitchcock.htm|archive-date=1 January 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their primary residence was an English-style home in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]], purchased in 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Variety obituary&quot;/&gt; Hitchcock's films were diverse during this period, ranging from the romantic comedy ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (1941 film)|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]'' (1941) to the bleak [[film noir]] ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943).

[[File:Cary Grant Joan Fontaine Suspicion.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Cary Grant]] and [[Joan Fontaine]] in a publicity shot for ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941)]]
{{anchor|Suspicion}}''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941) marked Hitchcock's first film as a producer and director. It is set in England; Hitchcock used the north coast of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] for the English coastline sequence. The film is the first of four in which [[Cary Grant]] was cast by Hitchcock, and it is one of the rare occasions that Grant plays a sinister character. Grant plays Johnnie Aysgarth, an English [[Confidence trick|conman]] whose actions raise suspicion and anxiety in his shy young English wife, Lina McLaidlaw ([[Joan Fontaine]]).{{sfn|Whitty|2016|pp=434–435}} In one scene, Hitchcock placed a light inside a glass of milk, perhaps poisoned, that Grant is bringing to his wife; the light ensures that the audience's attention is on the glass. Grant's character is actually a killer, as per written in the book, ''[[Before the Fact]]'' by [[Francis Iles]], but the studio felt that Grant's image would be tarnished by that. Hitchcock therefore settled for an ambiguous finale, although he would have preferred to end with the wife's murder.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|pp=142–143}}{{efn|Hitchcock told [[Bryan Forbes]] in 1967: &quot;They had gone through the film in my absence and taken out every scene that indicated the possibility that Cary Grant was a murderer. So there was no film existing at all. That was ridiculous. Nevertheless, I had to compromise on the end. What I wanted to do was that the wife was aware that she was going to be murdered by her husband, so she wrote a letter to her mother saying that she was very much in love with him, she didn't want live anymore, she was going to be killed but society should be protected. She therefore brings up this fatal glass of milk, drinks it and before she does she says, &quot;Will you mail this letter to mother?&quot; Then she drinks the milk and dies. You then have just one final scene of a cheerful Cary Grant going to the mailbox and posting the letter.&amp;nbsp;... But this was never permitted because of the basic error in casting.&quot;&lt;ref name=HitchcockForbes/&gt;}} Fontaine won [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for her performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Luther |first1=Claudia |title=Joan Fontaine, actress who won Oscar for 'Suspicion,' dies at 96 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/15/entertainment/la-et-mn-joan-fontaine-actress-who-won-oscar-for-suspicion-dies-at-96-20131215 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=15 December 2013|access-date=4 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327063921/http://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/15/entertainment/la-et-mn-joan-fontaine-actress-who-won-oscar-for-suspicion-dies-at-96-20131215|archive-date=27 March 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942) is the first of two films that Hitchcock made for [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] during the decade. Hitchcock was forced by Universal to use Universal contract player [[Robert Cummings]] and [[Priscilla Lane]], a freelancer who signed a one-picture deal with the studio, both known for their work in comedies and light dramas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Humphries|1994|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story depicts a confrontation between a suspected saboteur (Cummings) and a real saboteur ([[Norman Lloyd]]) atop the [[Statue of Liberty]]. Hitchcock took a three-day tour of New York City to scout for ''Saboteur''{{'}}s filming locations.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=445}} He also directed ''Have You Heard?'' (1942), a photographic dramatisation for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine of the [[Loose lips sink ships|dangers of rumours during wartime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=&quot;Have You Heard?&quot;: The Story of Wartime Rumors |date=13 July 1942 |magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3E0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA68 68]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, he wrote a mystery story for ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine, &quot;The Murder of [[Monty Woolley]]&quot;,{{sfn|Brunsdale|2010|p=442}} a sequence of captioned photographs inviting the reader to find clues to the murderer's identity; Hitchcock cast the performers as themselves, such as Woolley, Doris Merrick, and make-up man Guy Pearce.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Back in England, Hitchcock's mother Emma was severely ill; she died on 26 September 1942 at age 79. Hitchcock never spoke publicly about his mother, but his assistant said that he admired her.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=321}} Four months later, on 4 January 1943, his brother William died of an overdose at age 52.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=325}} Hitchcock was not very close to William,{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=193}} but his death made Hitchcock conscious about his own eating and drinking habits. He was overweight and suffering from back aches. His New Year's resolution in 1943 was to take his diet seriously with the help of a physician.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=326}} In January that year, ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' was released, which Hitchcock had fond memories of making.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=327}} In the film, Charlotte &quot;Charlie&quot; Newton ([[Teresa Wright]]) suspects her beloved uncle Charlie Oakley ([[Joseph Cotten]]) of being a serial killer. Hitchcock filmed extensively on location, this time in the Northern California city of [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Leitch |first1=Thomas |title=Shadow of a Doubt |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/static/national-film-preservation-board/documents/shadow_of_doubt.pdf |access-date=31 December 2017 |publisher=Library of Congress|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215151517/http://www.loc.gov/programs/static/national-film-preservation-board/documents/shadow_of_doubt.pdf|archive-date=15 February 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[20th Century Fox]], Hitchcock approached [[John Steinbeck]] with an idea for a film, which recorded the experiences of the survivors of a German [[U-boat]] attack. Steinbeck began work on the script for what would become ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944). However, Steinbeck was unhappy with the film and asked that his name be removed from the credits, to no avail. The idea was rewritten as a short story by [[Harry Sylvester]] and published in ''[[Collier's]]'' in 1943. The action sequences were shot in a small boat in the studio water tank. The locale posed problems for Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance; it was solved by having Hitchcock's image appear in a newspaper that [[William Bendix]] is reading in the boat, showing the director in a before-and-after advertisement for &quot;Reduco-Obesity Slayer&quot;. He told Truffaut in 1962:

{{blockquote|At the time, I was on a strenuous diet, painfully working my way from three hundred to two hundred pounds. So I decided to immortalize my loss and get my bit part by posing for &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; pictures.&amp;nbsp;... I was literally submerged by letters from fat people who wanted to know where and how they could get Reduco.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|pp=158–159}}}}

Hitchcock's typical dinner before his weight loss had been a roast chicken, boiled ham, potatoes, bread, vegetables, relishes, salad, dessert, a bottle of wine and some brandy. To lose weight, his diet consisted of black coffee for breakfast and lunch, and steak and salad for dinner,{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=326}} but it was hard to maintain; Donald Spoto wrote that his weight fluctuated considerably over the next 40 years. At the end of 1943, despite the weight loss, the Occidental Insurance Company of Los Angeles refused his application for life insurance.{{sfn|Spoto|1999|pp=266–267}}

Hitchcock returned to the UK for an extended visit in late 1943 and early 1944. While there he made two short [[propaganda film]]s, ''[[Bon Voyage (1944 film)|Bon Voyage]]'' (1944) and ''[[Aventure Malgache]]'' (1944), for the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]]. In June and July 1945, Hitchcock served as &quot;treatment advisor&quot; on a [[Holocaust]] documentary that used [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] footage of the liberation of [[Nazi concentration camps]]. The film was assembled in London and produced by [[Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein|Sidney Bernstein]] of the Ministry of Information, who brought Hitchcock (a friend of his) on board. It was originally intended to be broadcast to the Germans, but the British government deemed it too traumatic to be shown to a shocked post-war population. Instead, it was transferred in 1952 from the [[British War Office]] film vaults to London's [[Imperial War Museum]] and remained unreleased until 1985, when an edited version was broadcast as an episode of [[PBS]] ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'', under the title the Imperial War Museum had given it: ''Memory of the Camps''. The full-length version of the film, ''[[German Concentration Camps Factual Survey]]'', was restored in 2014 by scholars at the Imperial War Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|pages=372–374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jeffries9Jan2015&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jeffries |first1=Stuart |title=The Holocaust film that was too shocking to show |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/09/holocaust-film-too-shocking-to-show-night-will-fall-alfred-hitchcock |work=The Guardian |date=9 January 2015 |access-date=24 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110022047/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/09/holocaust-film-too-shocking-to-show-night-will-fall-alfred-hitchcock|archive-date=10 January 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Memory of the Camps: Frequently Asked Questions |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/camp/faqs.html |publisher=PBS |access-date=6 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222140552/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/camp/faqs.html|archive-date=22 February 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Later Selznick films====
[[File:Spellbound-1945.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gregory Peck]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]] in ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945)]]
Hitchcock worked for David Selznick again when he directed ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), which explores [[psychoanalysis]] and features a [[dream sequence]] designed by [[Salvador Dalí]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boyd |first=David |title=The Parted Eye: ''Spellbound'' and Psychoanalysis |url=https://www.sensesofcinema.com/2000/conference-for-the-love-of-fear/spellbound/ |year=2000 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211104103/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com:80/contents/00/6/spellbound.html |archive-date=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dream sequence as it appears in the film is ten minutes shorter than was originally envisioned; Selznick edited it to make it &quot;play&quot; more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leff|1987|pp=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gregory Peck]] plays amnesiac Dr. Anthony Edwardes under the treatment of analyst Dr. Peterson ([[Ingrid Bergman]]), who falls in love with him while trying to unlock his repressed past.{{sfn|Whitty|2016|pp=408–412}} Two [[Point-of-view shot|point-of-view]] shots were achieved by building a large wooden hand (which would appear to belong to the character whose point of view the camera took) and out-sized props for it to hold: a bucket-sized glass of milk and a large wooden gun. For added novelty and impact, the climactic gunshot was hand-coloured red on some copies of the black-and-white film. The original musical score by [[Miklós Rózsa]] makes use of the [[theremin]], and some of it was later adapted by the composer into Rozsa's Piano Concerto Op. 31 (1967) for piano and orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Miklos Rozsa Society Website |url=http://www.miklosrozsa.info/mrs/works/aboutPianoConcerto.html |year=2017 |access-date=13 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324124603/http://www.miklosrozsa.info/mrs/works/aboutPianoConcerto.html |archive-date=24 March 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2017}}

&lt;!--mention ''The Paradine Case'' (1947) and the Motion Picture Production Code--&gt;The spy film ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' followed next in 1946. Hitchcock told François Truffaut that Selznick sold him, Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant, and [[Ben Hecht]]'s screenplay, to [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] as a &quot;package&quot; for $500,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.5|1946|r=1}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}) because of cost overruns on Selznick's ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} ''Notorious'' stars Bergman and Grant, both Hitchcock collaborators, and features a plot about Nazis, [[uranium]] and South America. His prescient use of uranium as a plot device led to him being briefly placed under surveillance by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].{{Sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=168}} According to Patrick McGilligan, in or around March 1945, Hitchcock and Hecht consulted [[Robert Millikan]] of the [[California Institute of Technology]] about the development of a uranium bomb. Selznick complained that the notion was &quot;science fiction&quot;, only to be confronted by the news of the detonation of two atomic bombs on [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in Japan in August 1945.{{sfn|McGilligan|2003|pp=370–371}}

====Transatlantic Pictures====
[[File:Ropetrailer2.jpg|thumb|A typical shot from ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948) with [[James Stewart]] turning his back to the fixed camera|alt=A typical scene from ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' showing [[James Stewart]]]]

Hitchcock formed an independent production company, [[Transatlantic Pictures]], with his friend [[Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein|Sidney Bernstein]]. He made two films with Transatlantic, one of which was his first colour film. With ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'' (1948), Hitchcock experimented with marshalling suspense in a confined environment, as he had done earlier with ''Lifeboat''. The film appears as a very limited number of continuous shots, but it was actually shot in 10 ranging from 4-{{frac|2}} to 10 minutes each; a 10-minute length of film was the most that a camera's film magazine could hold at the time. Some transitions between reels were hidden by having a dark object fill the entire screen for a moment. Hitchcock used those points to hide the cut, and began the next take with the camera in the same place. The film features [[James Stewart]] in the leading role, and was the first of four films that Stewart made with Hitchcock. It was inspired by the [[Leopold and Loeb]] case of the 1920s.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=421}} Critical response at the time was mixed.{{sfn|Evans|2004|p=}}

''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949), set in 19th-century Australia, also uses the short-lived technique of long takes, but to a more limited extent. He again used [[Technicolor]] in this production, then returned to [[Black and white|black-and-white]] for several years. Transatlantic Pictures became inactive after the last two films.{{Sfn|Spoto|1999|p=138}}{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=179}} Hitchcock filmed ''[[Stage Fright (1950 film)|Stage Fright]]'' (1950) at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] in England, where he had worked during his British International Pictures contract many years before.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Warren|2001|pp=62, 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; He paired one of [[Warner Bros.]]' most popular stars, [[Jane Wyman]], with the expatriate German actor [[Marlene Dietrich]] and used several prominent British actors, including [[Michael Wilding (actor)|Michael Wilding]], [[Richard Todd]] and [[Alastair Sim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|Lasky|2002|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Hitchcock's first proper production for Warner Bros., which had distributed ''Rope'' and ''Under Capricorn'', because Transatlantic Pictures was experiencing financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|pp= 429, 774–775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Mention that, after falling out with Raymond Chandler, Hitchcock hired Czenzi Ormonde to work with Barbara Keon and Alma Reville; say more about the film, &quot;crisscross&quot;, and murder in spectacles scene--&gt;His thriller ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951) was based on the [[Strangers on a Train (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Patricia Highsmith]]. Hitchcock combined many elements from his preceding films. He approached [[Dashiell Hammett]] to write the dialogue, but [[Raymond Chandler]] took over, then left over disagreements with the director. In the film, two men casually meet, one of whom speculates on a foolproof method to murder; he suggests that two people, each wishing to do away with someone, should each perform the other's murder. [[Farley Granger]]'s role was as the innocent victim of the scheme, while [[Robert Walker (actor, born 1918)|Robert Walker]], previously known for &quot;boy-next-door&quot; roles, played the villain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|pp=320, 322}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[I Confess (film)|I Confess]]'' (1953) was set in [[Quebec City|Quebec]] with [[Montgomery Clift]] as a Catholic priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/78777/I-Confess/notes.html |title=Notes: ''I Confess'' (1953) |publisher=TCM |access-date=15 December 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122032808/http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/78777/I-Confess/notes.html | archive-date=22 November 2018 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Dial M for Murder'', [[Ray Milland]] plays the villain who tries to murder his unfaithful wife (Kelly) for her money.

Stewart's character is a photographer named Jeff (based on [[Robert Capa]]) who must temporarily use a wheelchair. Out of boredom, he begins observing his neighbours across the courtyard, then becomes convinced that one of them (Raymond Burr) has murdered his wife. Jeff eventually manages to convince his policeman buddy ([[Wendell Corey]]) and his girlfriend (Kelly). As with ''Lifeboat'' and ''Rope'', the principal characters are depicted in confined or cramped quarters, in this case Stewart's studio apartment. Hitchcock uses close-ups of Stewart's face to show his character's reactions, &quot;from the comic voyeurism directed at his neighbours to his helpless terror watching Kelly and Burr in the villain's apartment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title-sequence of the show pictured a minimalist caricature of his profile (he drew it himself; it is composed of only nine strokes), which his real silhouette then filled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=TV in the USA: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas |last=LoBrutto |first=Vincent |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |year=2018 |isbn=978-1-4408-2972-7 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series theme tune was ''Funeral March of a Marionette'' by the French composer [[Charles Gounod]] (1818–1893).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alfred Hitchcock (suspense anthology) |publisher=Media Management Group |url=http://www.classicthemes.com/50sTVThemes/themePages/alfredHitchcock.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221144330/http://www.classicthemes.com/50sTVThemes/themePages/alfredHitchcock.html |archive-date=21 February 2008|url-status=dead |access-date=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His introductions always included some sort of wry humour, such as the description of a recent multi-person execution hampered by having only one [[electric chair]], while two are shown with a sign &quot;Two chairs—no waiting!&quot; He directed 18 episodes of the series, which aired from 1955 to 1965. It became ''[[The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]'' in 1962, and NBC broadcast the final episode on 10 May 1965. In the 1980s, a [[Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1985 TV series)|new version]] of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' was produced for television, making use of Hitchcock's original introductions in a [[colourised]] form.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;/&gt;

Hitchcock's success in television spawned a set of short-story collections in his name; these included ''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Anthology]]'', ''Stories They Wouldn't Let Me Do on TV,'' and ''Tales My Mother Never Told Me''.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=202}} In 1956, HSD Publications also licensed the director's name to create ''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine]]'', a monthly [[Digest size|digest]] specialising in crime and detective fiction.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=202}} Hitchcock's television series' were very profitable, and his foreign-language versions of books were bringing revenues of up to $100,000 a year ({{Inflation|US|100,000|1960|fmt=eq|r=-4}}).{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=203}}&lt;!--making this invisible for now; not sure where to place it: Hitchcock also appears as a character in the juvenile detective book series, ''[[Three Investigators|Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators]]''. The long-running series was created by [[Robert Arthur (writer)|Robert Arthur]], who wrote the first few books. The Three Investigators—Jupiter Jones, Bob Andrews and Peter Crenshaw—were amateur detectives, slightly younger than the [[Hardy Boys]]. In the introduction to each book, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&quot; introduces the mystery, and he sometimes refers a case to the boys to solve. At the end of each book, the boys report to Hitchcock, and sometimes give him a memento of their case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;/&gt;--&gt;

====From ''To Catch a Thief'' to ''Vertigo''====
In 1955, Hitchcock became a United States citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p= 512}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, his third Grace Kelly film, ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'', was released; it is set in the [[French Riviera]], and stars Kelly and Cary Grant. Grant plays retired thief John Robie, who becomes the prime suspect for a spate of robberies in the Riviera. A thrill-seeking American heiress played by Kelly surmises his true identity and tries to seduce him. &quot;Despite the obvious age disparity between Grant and Kelly and a lightweight plot, the witty script (loaded with double entendres) and the good-natured acting proved a commercial success.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Leitch 2002. p. 366&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|p=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Hitchcock's last film with Kelly; she married [[Prince Rainier]] of Monaco in 1956, and ended her film career afterward. Hitchcock then remade his own [[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|1934 film]] ''The Man Who Knew Too Much'' [[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|in 1956]]. This time, the film starred James Stewart and [[Doris Day]], who sang the theme song &quot;[[Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)|Que Sera, Sera]]&quot;, which won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and became a big hit. They play a couple whose son is kidnapped to prevent them from interfering with an assassination. As in the 1934 film, the climax takes place at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1994|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Wrong Man]]'' (1956), Hitchcock's final film for Warner Bros., is a low-key black-and-white production based on a real-life case of [[mistaken identity]] reported in ''Life'' magazine in 1953. This was the only film of Hitchcock to star [[Henry Fonda]], playing a [[Stork Club]] musician mistaken for a liquor store thief, who is arrested and tried for robbery while his wife ([[Vera Miles]]) emotionally collapses under the strain. Hitchcock told Truffaut that his lifelong fear of the police attracted him to the subject and was embedded in many scenes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leitch 2002. p. 377&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|p=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--1957, [[Claude Chabrol]] and [[Éric Rohmer]], first book-length study of his work--&gt;&lt;!--moved this from the &quot;relationship with actors&quot; section: In the late 1950s, [[French New Wave]] critics, especially Truffaut, [[Claude Chabrol]] and [[Éric Rohmer]], were among the first to see and promote Hitchcock's films as artistic works.

While directing episodes for ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' during the summer of 1957, Hitchcock was admitted to hospital for [[hernia]] and [[gallstone]]s, and had to have his [[gallbladder]] removed. Following a successful surgery, he immediately returned to work to prepare for his next project.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=212}}{{Sfn|Evans|2004|p=}} ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958) again starred James Stewart, with [[Kim Novak]] and [[Barbara Bel Geddes]]. He had wanted [[Vera Miles]] to play the lead, but she was pregnant. He told [[Oriana Fallaci]]: &quot;I was offering her a big part, the chance to become a beautiful sophisticated blonde, a real actress. We'd have spent a heap of dollars on it, and she has the bad taste to get pregnant. I hate pregnant women, because then they have children.&quot;{{sfn|Fallaci|1963}}

In ''Vertigo'', Stewart plays Scottie, a former police investigator suffering from [[acrophobia]], who becomes obsessed with a woman he has been hired to shadow (Novak). Scottie's obsession leads to tragedy, and this time Hitchcock did not opt for a happy ending. Some critics, including Donald Spoto and [[Roger Ebert]], agree that ''Vertigo'' is the director's most personal and revealing film, dealing with the ''[[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]]''-like obsessions of a man who moulds a woman into the person he desires. ''Vertigo'' explores more frankly and at greater length his interest in the relation between sex and death, than any other work in his filmography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kehr|2011|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vertigo'' contains a camera technique developed by Irmin Roberts, commonly referred to as a [[dolly zoom]], which has been copied by many filmmakers. The film premiered at the [[San Sebastián International Film Festival]], and Hitchcock won the Silver Seashell prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Sebastian Film Festival|url=https://www.sansebastianfestival.com:443/1958/awards_and_jury_members/awards/1/51/in|access-date=19 November 2020|website=San Sebastian Film Festival|archive-date=2 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002204434/https://www.sansebastianfestival.com/1958/awards_and_jury_members/awards/1/51/in}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vertigo'' is considered a classic, but it attracted mixed reviews and poor box-office receipts at the time;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ravetto-Biagioli|first1=Kriss|last2=Beugnet|first2=Martine|date=27 September 2019|title=Vertiginous Hauntings: The Ghosts of Vertigo|journal=Film-Philosophy|volume=23|issue=3|pages=227–246|doi=10.3366/film.2019.0114|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; the critic from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine opined that the film was &quot;too slow and too long&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=14 May 1958|title=Vertigo|url=https://variety.com/1958/film/reviews/vertigo-2-1200419207/|access-date=19 November 2020|website=Variety|archive-date=28 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228012042/http://variety.com/1958/film/reviews/vertigo-2-1200419207/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bosley Crowther]] of the ''New York Times'' thought it was &quot;devilishly far-fetched&quot;, but praised the cast performances and Hitchcock's direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|date=29 May 1958|title=Vertigo,' Hitchcock's Latest; Melodrama Arrives at the Capitol (Published 1958)|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1958/05/29/archives/vertigo-hitchcocks-latest-melodrama-arrives-at-the-capitol.html|access-date=19 November 2020|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=23 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190823175858/https://www.nytimes.com/1958/05/29/archives/vertigo-hitchcocks-latest-melodrama-arrives-at-the-capitol.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The picture was also the last collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leitch 2002. p. 376-77&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2002 ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' polls, it ranked just behind ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941); ten years later, in the same magazine, critics chose it as the best film ever made.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christie2012&quot; /&gt;

====''North by Northwest'' and ''Psycho''====
{{see also|Psycho (franchise)}}
After ''Vertigo'', the rest of 1958 was a difficult year for Hitchcock. During [[pre-production]] of ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), which was a &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;agonising&quot; process, his wife Alma was diagnosed with cancer.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=217}} While she was in hospital, Hitchcock kept himself occupied with his television work and would visit her every day. Alma underwent surgery and made a full recovery, but it caused Hitchcock to imagine, for the first time, life without her.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=217}}

Hitchcock followed up with three more successful films, which are also recognised as among his best: ''North by Northwest'', ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960) and ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963). In ''North by Northwest'', Cary Grant portrays Roger Thornhill, a [[Madison Avenue]] advertising executive who is mistaken for a government secret agent. He is pursued across the United States by enemy agents, including Eve Kendall ([[Eva Marie Saint]]). At first, Thornhill believes Kendall is helping him, but then realises that she is an enemy agent; he later learns that she is working undercover for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. During its opening two-week run at [[Radio City Music Hall]], the film grossed $404,056 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.404056|1959|r=1}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), setting a non-holiday gross record for that theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,864921,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120530114819/http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,864921,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 May 2012 |title=Box Office: For the Books |date=31 August 1959 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called the film &quot;smoothly troweled and thoroughly entertaining&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,937893,00.html |title=Cinema: The New Pictures |date=17 August 1959 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=21 August 2017 |archive-date=30 May 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120530114820/http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,937893,00.html |url-status=dead }}{{pb}}

&lt;!--expand--&gt;On 13 August 1962, Hitchcock's 63rd birthday, the French director [[François Truffaut]] began a 50-hour interview of Hitchcock, filmed over eight days at Universal Studios, during which Hitchcock agreed to answer 500 questions. It took four years to transcribe the tapes and organise the images; it was published as a book in 1967, which Truffaut nicknamed the &quot;Hitchbook&quot;. The audio tapes were used as the basis of a documentary in 2015.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=12}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jeffries |first1=Stuart |title='Actors are cattle': when Hitchcock met Truffaut |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/12/when-hitchcock-met-truffaut-hitchcock-truffaut-documentary-cannes |work=The Guardian |date=12 May 2015|access-date=16 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117131315/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/12/when-hitchcock-met-truffaut-hitchcock-truffaut-documentary-cannes|archive-date=17 January 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truffaut sought the interview because it was clear to him that Hitchcock was not simply the mass-market entertainer the American media made him out to be. It was obvious from his films, Truffaut wrote, that Hitchcock had &quot;given more thought to the potential of his art than any of his colleagues&quot;. He compared the interview to &quot;Oedipus' consultation of the oracle&quot;.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|pp=11–12}}

[[File:Marnie (1964) trailer.webm|thumb|Trailer for ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964)]]

In June 1962, Grace Kelly announced that she had decided against appearing in ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964).&lt;!--explain why?--&gt; Hedren had signed an exclusive seven-year, $500-a-week contract with Hitchcock in October 1961,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1996|p=270}};

In 2016, describing Hedren's performance as &quot;one of the greatest in the history of cinema&quot;, [[Richard Brody]] called the film a &quot;story of sexual violence&quot; inflicted on the character played by Hedren: &quot;The film is, to put it simply, sick, and it's so because Hitchcock was sick. He suffered all his life from furious sexual desire, suffered from the lack of its gratification, suffered from the inability to transform fantasy into reality, and then went ahead and did so virtually, by way of his art.&quot;&lt;ref name=Brody17Aug2016&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Brody |first1=Richard|author-link=Richard Brody |title=&quot;Marnie&quot; Is the Cure for Hitchcock Mania |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/marnie-is-the-cure-for-hitchcock-mania |magazine=The New Yorker |date=17 August 2016|access-date=2 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103072926/https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/marnie-is-the-cure-for-hitchcock-mania|archive-date=3 January 2018|url-status=live}}{{pb}}

In the film, Marnie Edgar (Hedren) steals $10,000 from her employer and goes on the run. She applies for a job at Mark Rutland's (Connery) company in Philadelphia and steals from there too. Earlier she is shown having a panic attack during a thunderstorm and fearing the colour red. Mark tracks her down and blackmails her into marrying him. She explains that she does not want to be touched, but during the &quot;honeymoon&quot;, Mark rapes her. Marnie and Mark discover that Marnie's mother had been a prostitute when Marnie was a child, and that, while the mother was fighting with a client during a thunderstorm—the mother believed the client had tried to molest Marnie—Marnie had killed the client to save her mother. Cured of her fears when she remembers what happened, she decides to stay with Mark.&lt;ref name=Brody17Aug2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cleaver13Aug2012&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cleaver |first1=Emily |title=My favourite Hitchcock: Marnie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/aug/13/my-favourite-hitchcock-marnie |work=The Guardian |date=13 August 2012|access-date=27 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227122740/https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/aug/13/my-favourite-hitchcock-marnie|archive-date=27 December 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock told cinematographer [[Robert Burks]] that the camera had to be placed as close as possible to Hedren when he filmed her face.{{sfn|Spoto|1999|p=471}} [[Ed McBain|Evan Hunter]], the screenwriter of ''The Birds'' who was writing ''Marnie'' too, explained to Hitchcock that, if Mark loved Marnie, he would comfort her, not rape her.

===Later years: 1966–1980===
====Final films====
Failing health reduced Hitchcock's output during the last two decades of his life. Biographer [[Stephen Rebello]] claimed Universal imposed two films on him, ''[[Torn Curtain]]'' (1966) and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'' (1969), the latter of which is based on a [[Leon Uris]] novel, partly set in Cuba.{{Sfn|Rebello|1990|p=188}} Both were spy thrillers with [[Cold War]]-related themes. ''Torn Curtain'', with [[Paul Newman]] and [[Julie Andrews]], precipitated the bitter end of the 12-year collaboration between Hitchcock and composer [[Bernard Herrmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2002|pp=272–274}}; {{cite news |last=Stephens |first=Andrew |title=The sound of Hitchcock: How Bernard Herrmann's music brought his films to life |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/the-sound-of-hitchcock-how-bernard-herrmanns-music-brought-his-films-to-life-20160104-glys29.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=9 January 2016|access-date=20 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319215055/http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/the-sound-of-hitchcock-how-bernard-herrmanns-music-brought-his-films-to-life-20160104-glys29.html|archive-date=19 March 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock was unhappy with Herrmann's score and replaced him with [[John Addison]], [[Jay Livingston]] and [[Ray Evans]].{{sfn|Smith|2002|pp=273–274}} Upon release, ''Torn Curtain'' was a box office disappointment,{{Sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=328}} and ''Topaz'' was disliked by critics and the studio.{{Sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=333}}

[[File:Alfred Hitchcock, San Francisco, Summer 1975.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Image of Hitchcock seated during the filming of Family Plot| Hitchcock at work on ''[[Family Plot]]'', San Francisco, summer 1975]]

Hitchcock returned to Britain to make his penultimate film, ''[[Frenzy]]'' (1972), based on the novel ''[[Goodbye Piccadilly, Farewell Leicester Square]]'' (1966). After two espionage films, the plot marked a return to the murder-thriller genre. Richard Blaney ([[Jon Finch]]), a volatile barman with a history of explosive anger, becomes the prime suspect in the investigation into the &quot;Necktie Murders&quot;, which are actually committed by his friend Bob Rusk ([[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]]). This time, Hitchcock makes the victim and villain kindreds, rather than opposites as in ''Strangers on a Train''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leitch|2002|pp=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Frenzy'', Hitchcock allowed nudity for the first time. Two scenes show naked women, one of whom is being raped and strangled;{{sfn|Evans|2004|p=}} Donald Spoto called the latter &quot;one of the most repellent examples of a detailed murder in the history of film&quot;. Both actors, [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] and [[Anna Massey]], refused to do the scenes, so models were used instead.{{sfn|Spoto|1999|pp=513–514}} Biographers have noted that Hitchcock had always pushed the limits of film censorship, often managing to fool [[Joseph Breen]], the head of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]]. Hitchcock would add subtle hints of improprieties forbidden by censorship until the mid-1960s. Yet Patrick McGilligan wrote that Breen and others often realised that Hitchcock was inserting such material and were actually amused, as well as alarmed by Hitchcock's &quot;inescapable inferences&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976) was Hitchcock's last film. It relates the escapades of &quot;Madam&quot; Blanche Tyler, played by [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]], a fraudulent spiritualist, and her taxi-driver lover [[Bruce Dern]], making a living from her phony powers. While ''Family Plot'' was based on the [[Victor Canning]] novel ''[[The Rainbird Pattern]]'' (1972), the novel's tone is more sinister. Screenwriter [[Ernest Lehman]] originally wrote the film, under the working title ''Deception'', with a dark tone but was pushed to a lighter, more comical tone by Hitchcock where it took the name ''Deceit'', then finally, ''Family Plot''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hollenback|first=Sharon Sue Rountree|title=Analysis Of Processes Involved In Screenwriting As Demonstrated In Screenplays By Ernest Lehman|publisher=Ann Arbor|year=1980|isbn=9798644965205|location=United States|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Knighthood and death====
&lt;!--add American Film Institute Life Achievement Award and speech about his wife--&gt;[[File:Alfred Hitchcock by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|c. 1972 by [[Jack Mitchell (photographer)|Jack Mitchell]]]] Toward the end of his life, Hitchcock was working on the script for a spy thriller, ''[[The Short Night]]'', collaborating with [[James Costigan]], [[Ernest Lehman]] and [[David Freeman (screenwriter)|David Freeman]]. Despite preliminary work, it was never filmed. Hitchcock's health was declining and he was worried about his wife, who had suffered a stroke. The screenplay was eventually published in Freeman's book ''The Last Days of Alfred Hitchcock'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McGilligan|2003|pp= 731–734}}; {{harvnb|Freeman|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock's film production career evolved from small-scale silent films to financially significant sound films. Hitchcock remarked that he was influenced by early filmmakers George Méliès, D.W.

Whilst [[Visual narrative|visual storytelling]] was pertinent during the silent era, even after the arrival of sound, Hitchcock still relied on visuals in cinema; he referred to this emphasis on visual storytelling as &quot;pure cinema&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nofilmschool.com/alfred-hitchcock-advice-quotes|title=Get Alfred Hitchcock's Advice, In His Own Words|website=No Film School|last=Edelman|first=George|date=13 August 2020|accessdate=17 December 2021|quote=Cinema is form.

Trying to make them cinema some directors find odd angles to shoot from, but they still only produce what I call 'photographs of people talking.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, he honed his craft so that by the time he moved to Hollywood, the director had perfected his style and camera techniques. Hitchcock later said that his British work was the &quot;sensation of cinema&quot;, whereas the American phase was when his &quot;ideas were fertilised&quot;.{{Sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=123}} Scholar [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] writes that the director's first two films, ''The Pleasure Garden'' and ''The Mountain Eagle'', were influenced by [[German Expressionism]]. Afterward, he discovered [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet cinema]], and [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]]'s theories of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]].{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=75}} 1926's ''The Lodger'' was inspired by both German and Soviet aesthetics, styles which solidified the rest of his career.{{Sfn|Wood|2002|p=207}} Although Hitchcock's work in the 1920s found some success, several British reviewers criticised Hitchcock's films for being unoriginal and conceited.{{Sfn|Sloan|1995|p=17}} [[Raymond Durgnat]] opined that Hitchcock's films were carefully and intelligently constructed, but thought they can be shallow and rarely present a &quot;coherent worldview&quot;.{{Sfn|Sloan|1995|p=400}}

Earning the title &quot;Master of Suspense&quot;, the director experimented with ways to generate tension in his work.{{Sfn|Sloan|1995|p=17}} He said, &quot;My suspense work comes out of creating nightmares for the audience. And I ''play'' with an audience. I make them gasp and surprise them and shock them. When you have a nightmare, it's awfully vivid if you're dreaming that you're being led to the electric chair.

One of the dramatic reasons for this type of photography is to get it looking so natural that the audience gets involved and believes, for the time being, what's going on up there on the screen.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; In a 1963 interview with Italian journalist [[Oriana Fallaci]], Hitchcock was asked how in spite of appearing to be a pleasant, innocuous man, he seemed to enjoy making films involving suspense and terrifying crime. He responded:{{blockquote|I'm English. The English use a lot of imagination with their crimes. I don't get such a kick out of anything as much as out of imagining a crime. When I'm writing a story and I come to a crime, I think happily: now wouldn't it be nice to have him die like this? And then, even more happily, I think: at this point people will start yelling. It must be because I spent three years studying with the Jesuits. They used to terrify me to death, with everything, and now I'm getting my own back by terrifying other people.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2003|p=56}}}}

Hitchcock's films, from the silent to the sound era, contained a number of recurring themes that he is famous for. His films explored audience as a [[Voyeurism|voyeur]], notably in ''Rear Window'', ''Marnie'' and ''Psycho''. He understood that human beings enjoy voyeuristic activities and made the audience participate in it through the character's actions.{{Sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=216}} Of his fifty-three films, eleven revolved around stories of [[mistaken identity]], where an innocent protagonist is accused of a crime and is pursued by police. In most cases, it is an ordinary, everyday person who finds themselves in a dangerous situation.{{Sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=48}} Hitchcock told Truffaut: &quot;That's because the theme of the innocent man being accused, I feel, provides the audience with a greater sense of danger. It's easier for them to identify with him than with a guilty man on the run.&quot;{{Sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=48}} One of his constant themes were the struggle of a personality torn between &quot;order and chaos&quot;;{{Sfn|Wood|2002|p=98}} known as the notion of &quot;double&quot;, which is a comparison or contrast between two characters or objects: the double representing a dark or evil side.{{Sfn|Evans|2004|p=}}

According to Robin Wood, Hitchcock had mixed feelings towards homosexuality despite working with gay actors in his career.{{Sfn|Wood|2002|p=342}} Donald Spoto suggests that Hitchcock's [[Sexual repression|sexually repressive]] childhood may have contributed to his exploration of [[Deviance (sociology)|deviancy]].{{Sfn|Wood|2002|p=342}} During the 1950s, the [[Motion Picture Production Code]] prohibited direct references to homosexuality but the director was known for his subtle references,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hosier|first1=Connie Russell|last2=Badman|first2=Scott|date=7 February 2017|title=Gay Coding in Hitchcock Films|url=https://www.us.mensa.org/read/bulletin/features/gay-coding-in-hitchcock-films/|access-date=25 November 2020|website=American Mensa|archive-date=7 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201107230929/https://www.us.mensa.org/read/bulletin/features/gay-coding-in-hitchcock-films/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pushing the boundaries of the censors. Moreover, ''Shadow of a Doubt'' has a double [[incest]] theme through the storyline, expressed implicitly through images.{{Sfn|Wood|2002|p=300}} Author Jane Sloan argues that Hitchcock was drawn to both conventional and unconventional sexual expression in his work,{{Sfn|Sloan|1995|p=16}} and the theme of marriage was usually presented in a &quot;bleak and skeptical&quot; manner.{{Sfn|Wood|2002|p=246}} It was also not until after his mother's death in 1942, that Hitchcock portrayed motherly figures as &quot;notorious monster-mothers&quot;.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=321}} The [[espionage]] backdrop, and murders committed by characters with [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]] tendencies were common themes too.{{Sfn|McGilligan|2003|p=128}} In Hitchcock's depiction of villains and murderers, they were usually charming and friendly, forcing viewers to identify with them.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=293}} The director's strict childhood and Jesuit education may have led to his distrust of authoritarian figures such as policemen and politicians; a theme which he has explored.{{Sfn|Evans|2004|p=}} Also, he used the &quot;[[MacGuffin]]&quot;—the use of an object, person or event to keep the plot moving along even if it was non-essential to the story.{{Sfn|Taylor|1996|p=120}} Some examples include the microfilm in ''North by Northwest'' and the stolen $40,000 in ''Psycho''.

Hitchcock appears briefly in most of his own films. For example, he is seen struggling to get a double bass onto a train (''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]''), walking dogs out of a pet shop (''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]''), fixing a neighbour's clock (''[[Rear Window]]''), as a shadow (''[[Family Plot]]''), sitting at a table in a photograph (''[[Dial M for Murder]]''), and riding a bus (''[[North by Northwest]]'','' [[To Catch a Thief]]'').{{sfn|Walker|2005|p=88}}

[[File:Vertigo 1958 trailer embrace.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kim Novak]] and [[James Stewart]] in ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958)]]
The victims in ''The Lodger'' are all blondes. In ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', [[Madeleine Carroll]] is put in handcuffs. [[Ingrid Bergman]], whom Hitchcock directed three times (''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'', ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'', and ''[[Under Capricorn]]''), is dark blonde. In ''Rear Window'', Lisa ([[Grace Kelly]]) risks her life by breaking into Lars Thorwald's apartment. In ''To Catch a Thief'', Francie (also Kelly) offers to help a man she believes is a burglar. In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' and ''North by Northwest'' respectively, [[Kim Novak]] and [[Eva Marie Saint]] play the blonde heroines. In ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Janet Leigh]]'s character steals $40,000 and is murdered by [[Norman Bates]], a reclusive psychopath. [[Tippi Hedren]], a blonde, appears to be the focus of the attacks in ''The Birds''. In ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'', the title character, again played by Hedren, is a thief. In ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', French actresses [[Dany Robin]] as Stafford's wife and [[Claude Jade]] as Stafford's daughter are blonde heroines, the mistress was played by brunette [[Karin Dor]]. Hitchcock's last blonde heroine was [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as a phony psychic turned amateur sleuth in ''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976), his final film. In the same film, the diamond smuggler played by [[Karen Black]] wears a long blonde wig in several scenes.

His films often feature characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers, such as Norman Bates in ''Psycho''. In ''North by Northwest'', Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]) is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy, murderous men are after him. In ''The Birds'', the Rod Taylor character, an innocent man, finds his world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free himself from a clinging mother ([[Jessica Tandy]]). The killer in ''Frenzy'' has a loathing of women but idolises his mother. The villain Bruno in ''Strangers on a Train'' hates his father, but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother (played by [[Marion Lorne]]). Sebastian ([[Claude Rains]]) in ''Notorious'' has a clearly conflicting relationship with his mother, who is (rightly) suspicious of his new bride, Alicia Huberman ([[Ingrid Bergman]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaganski|1997|pp=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--replace source--&gt;

Hitchcock became known for having remarked that &quot;actors should be treated like cattle&quot;.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=140}}{{efn|Hitchcock told Fallaci in 1963: &quot;When they [actors] aren't cows, they're children: that's something else I've often said. And everyone knows that there are good children, bad children, and stupid children. The majority of actors, though, are stupid children. They're always quarreling, and they give themselves a lot of airs. The less I see of them, the happier I am. I had much less trouble directing fifteen hundred crows than one single actor. I've always said that Walt Disney has the right idea. His actors are made of paper; when he doesn't like them, he can tear them up.&quot;{{sfn|Fallaci|1963}}}} During the filming of ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (1941 film)|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]'' (1941), [[Carole Lombard]] brought three cows onto the set wearing the name tags of Lombard, [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]], and [[Gene Raymond]], the stars of the film, to surprise him.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|p=140}} In an episode of ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', originally broadcast on 8 June 1972,  [[Dick Cavett]] stated as fact that Hitchcock had once called actors cattle. Hitchcock responded by saying that, at one time, he had been accused of calling actors cattle. &quot;I said that I would never say such an unfeeling, rude thing about actors at all. What I probably said, was that all actors should be treated like cattle...In a nice way of course.&quot; He then described Carole Lombard's joke, with a smile.&lt;ref&gt;This [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuD1yloq5pY portion of the interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200703161148/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuD1yloq5pY&amp;feature=youtu.be |date=3 July 2020 }} is available on youtube. The entire episode is available on Criterion.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock believed that actors should concentrate on their performances and leave work on script and character to the directors and screenwriters. He told [[Bryan Forbes]] in 1967: &quot;I remember discussing with a method actor how he was taught and so forth. He said, 'We're taught using improvisation. We are given an idea and then we are turned loose to develop in any way we want to.' I said, 'That's not acting. That's writing.'&quot;&lt;ref name=HitchcockForbes&gt;{{cite web |title=Alfred Hitchcock |publisher=British Film Institute |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/interviews/hitchcock.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210051052/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/interviews/hitchcock.html#actors |archive-date=10 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recalling their experiences on ''Lifeboat'' for Charles Chandler, author of ''It's Only a Movie: Alfred Hitchcock A Personal Biography,'' [[Walter Slezak]] said that Hitchcock &quot;knew more about how to help an actor than any director I ever worked with&quot;, and [[Hume Cronyn]] dismissed the idea that Hitchcock was not concerned with his actors as &quot;utterly fallacious&quot;, describing at length the process of rehearsing and filming ''Lifeboat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=It's Only a Movie: Alfred Hitchcock A Personal Biography |publisher=Simon and Schuster |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oKRhkdxsFs8C&amp;pg=PT133 |isbn=978-1-84739-709-6 |date=9 December 2008 |access-date=14 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191222214437/https://books.google.com/books?id=oKRhkdxsFs8C&amp;pg=PT133 |archive-date=22 December 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics observed that, despite his reputation as a man who disliked actors, actors who worked with him often gave brilliant performances. He used the same actors in many of his films; Cary Grant and James Stewart both worked with Hitchcock four times,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White|2011|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ingrid Bergman and Grace Kelly three. [[James Mason]] said that Hitchcock regarded actors as &quot;animated props&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitty|2016|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Hitchcock, the actors were part of the film's setting. He told François Truffaut: &quot;The chief requisite for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds. He should be willing to be used and wholly integrated into the picture by the director and the camera. He must allow the camera to determine the proper emphasis and the most effective dramatic highlights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Truffaut|1983|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing, storyboards and production===
Hitchcock planned his scripts in detail with his writers. In ''Writing with Hitchcock'' (2001), Steven DeRosa noted that Hitchcock supervised them through every draft, asking that they tell the story visually.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|DeRosa|2001|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock told [[Roger Ebert]] in 1969:

{{blockquote|Once the screenplay is finished, I'd just as soon not make the film at all. All the fun is over. I have a strongly visual mind. I visualize a picture right down to the final cuts. I write all this out in the greatest detail in the script, and then I don't look at the script while I'm shooting. I know it off by heart, just as an orchestra conductor needs not look at the score. It's melancholy to shoot a picture. When you finish the script, the film is perfect. But in shooting it you lose perhaps 40 per cent of your original conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/hitchcock-never-mess-about-with-a-dead-body-you-may-be-one |title=Hitchcock: &quot;Never mess about with a dead body—you may be one&amp;nbsp;.... |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=14 December 1969|access-date=11 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212084523/https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/hitchcock-never-mess-about-with-a-dead-body-you-may-be-one|archive-date=12 December 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hitchcock's films were extensively [[storyboard]]ed to the finest detail. He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the [[viewfinder]], since he did not need to, although in publicity photos he was shown doing so. He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision. If a studio asked him to change a film, he would claim that it was already shot in a single way, and that there were no alternative takes to consider.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Krohn, Hitchcock at Work (London: Phaidon, 2000), p. 9. cited in {{cite book |last1=Pallant |first1=Chris |title=Hitchcock and Storyboarding |year=2015 |work=Storyboarding: A Critical History |pages=112|editor-last=Pallant|editor-first=Chris |series=Palgrave Studies in Screenwriting |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK |doi=10.1057/9781137027603_6 |isbn=978-1-137-02760-3 |last2=Price |first2=Steven|editor2-last=Price|editor2-first=Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alfred Hitchcock on the set of North By Northwest.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt= Image of Hitchcock pictured under Mount Rushmore during the filming of North by Northwest|Hitchcock at [[Mount Rushmore]] filming ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959)]]
This view of Hitchcock as a director who relied more on pre-production than on the actual production itself has been challenged by Bill Krohn, the American correspondent of French film magazine ''[[Cahiers du Cinéma]]'', in his book ''Hitchcock at Work''. After investigating script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock, and other production material, Krohn observed that Hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned.&lt;ref name= &quot;krohn1–7&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Krohn|2000|pp=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his films, was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios. For example, the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of ''North by Northwest'' was not storyboarded at all. After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film, and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bellour|Penley|2000|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=December 2017}}

Even when storyboards were made, scenes that were shot differed from them significantly. Krohn's analysis of the production of Hitchcock classics like ''Notorious'' reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of ''The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]''. While Hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his films, he was fully cognisant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines used during many other film productions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217&quot;/&gt;{{verify source|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Alfred Hitchcock Extended Interview.ogv|thumb|alt= Close-up of Hitchcock for a media clip of a 1966 interview|Hitchcock interview, c. 1966]]
Krohn's work also sheds light on Hitchcock's practice of generally shooting in chronological order, which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era. Equally important is Hitchcock's tendency to shoot alternative takes of scenes. This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how they chose (often under the producer's aegis).&lt;ref name=&quot;Heritage02-28-07&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Lehman |first=David |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml |title=Alfred Hitchcock's America |work=American Heritage |date=April–May 2007|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711184905/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml |archive-date=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}} Rather they represented Hitchcock's tendency to give himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work.

According to Krohn, this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcock's personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of Hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock. Both his fastidiousness and attention to detail also found their way into each [[film poster]] for his films. Hitchcock preferred to work with the best talent of his day—film poster designers such as [[Bill Gold]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Poster Master With a Cool Hand |first=Mekado |last=Murphy |date=3 December 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/movies/05posters.html|access-date=5 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223132525/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/movies/05posters.html|archive-date=23 December 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saul Bass]]—who would produce posters that accurately represented his films.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217&quot;/&gt;

'''Anacondas''' or '''water boas''' are a group of large [[snake]]s of the [[genus]] ''[[Eunectes]]''. They are found in tropical [[South America]]. Four [[species]] are currently recognized.

==Description==
Although the name applies to a group of snakes, it is often used to refer only to one species, in particular, the common or [[green anaconda]] (''Eunectes murinus''), which is the largest snake in the world by weight, and the second longest.

==Etymology==
The South American names ''anacauchoa'' and ''anacaona'' were suggested in an account by [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]], but the idea of a South American origin was questioned by [[Henry Walter Bates]] who, in his travels in South America, failed to find any similar name in use. The word anaconda is derived from the name of a snake from Ceylon ([[Sri Lanka]]) that [[John Ray]] described in Latin in his ''Synopsis Methodica Animalium'' (1693) as ''serpens indicus bubalinus anacandaia zeylonibus, ides bubalorum aliorumque jumentorum membra conterens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ray|first=John|author-link=John Ray|year=1693|title=Synopsis methodica animalium quadrupedum et serpentini generis|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/28832440|page=332|language=la|publisher=Impensis S. Smith &amp; B. Walford|location=London|doi=10.5962/bhl.title.41459|via=Biodiversity Heritage Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray used a catalogue of snakes from the [[Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie|Leyden museum]] supplied by Dr. [[Tancred Robinson]], but the description of its habit was based on [[Andreas Cleyer]] who in 1684 described a gigantic snake that crushed large animals by coiling around their bodies and crushing their bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles|last=Owen|year=1742|title=An essay towards a natural history of serpents|page=114|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/38946374|location=London|doi=10.5962/bhl.title.58688|via=Biodiversity Heritage Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Yule]] in his [[Hobson-Jobson]] notes that the word became more popular due to a piece of fiction published in 1768 in the Scots Magazine by a certain R. Edwin. Edwin described a '[[tiger]]' being crushed to death by an anaconda, when there actually never were any tigers in Sri Lanka.{{efn|In [[South Asia]]n languages like Hindi, the [[leopard]] and [[tiger]] may share the same name, that is ''Bágh'' ({{lang-hi|बाघ}}), and it is the former that occurs in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pocock1930&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pocock |first=Reginald I. |author-link=Reginald Innes Pocock |title=The Panthers and Ounces of Asia |journal=Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society |volume=34 |issue=2 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/48295762 |pages=307–336 |year=1930 |via=Biodiversity Heritage Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Yule and [[Frank Wall (herpetologist)|Frank Wall]] noted that the snake was in fact a python and suggested a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] origin ''anai-kondra'' meaning elephant killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wall |first=Frank |author-link=Frank Wall (herpetologist) |year=1921 |title=Ophidia Taprobanica or the Snakes of Ceylon |publisher=H.

The name commonly used for the anaconda in Brazil is ''sucuri'', ''sucuriju'' or ''sucuriuba''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dicionário online de português: sucuriju|url=http://www.dicio.com.br/sucuriju/|language=pt|access-date=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Anaconda Redpath museum.jpg|thumb|left|upright=2.5|Skeleton at the [[Redpath Museum]]]]

==Species and other uses of the term &quot;anaconda&quot; ==
The term &quot;anaconda&quot; has been used to refer to:

[[File:Eunectes murinus - Flickr - Dick Culbert.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Eunectes murinus'' in Colombia]]
* Any member of the genus ''[[Eunectes]]'', a group of large, aquatic snakes found in South America:
** ''[[Eunectes murinus]]'', the green anaconda – the largest species, found east of the Andes in Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]
** ''[[Eunectes notaeus]]'', the yellow anaconda – a small species, found in eastern Bolivia, southern Brazil, Paraguay, and northeastern Argentina
** ''[[Eunectes deschauenseei]]'', the darkly-spotted anaconda – a rare species, found in northeastern Brazil and coastal French Guiana
** ''[[Eunectes beniensis]]'', the Bolivian anaconda – the most recently defined species, found in the Departments of Beni and Pando in [[Bolivia]]
** The term was previously applied imprecisely, indicating any large snake that [[constriction|constricts]] its prey,&lt;ref name=&quot;COED&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Simpson|editor1-first=J. A.|editor2-last=Weiner|editor2-first=E. S.

** &quot;Anaconda&quot; is also used as a metaphor for an action aimed at constricting and suffocating an opponent – for example, the [[Anaconda Plan]] proposed at the beginning of the [[American Civil War]], in which the Union Army was to effectively &quot;suffocate&quot; the Confederacy. Another example is the [[Arm triangle choke#Anaconda choke|anaconda choke]] in the martial art [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], which is performed by wrapping your arms under the opponent's neck and through the armpit, and grasping the biceps of the opposing arm, when caught in this move, you will lose consciousness if you do not tap out.

The '''Arctic fox''' ('''''Vulpes lagopus'''''), also known as the '''white fox''', '''polar fox''', or '''snow fox''', is a small [[fox]] native to the [[Arctic]] regions of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and common throughout the [[Tundra#Arctic tundra|Arctic tundra]] [[biome]].&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt;&lt;ref name=msw3&gt;{{MSW3 Wozencraft |id=14000873}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/a/arctic-fox/|title=Arctic Fox {{!}} National Geographic|date=2010-09-10|website=Animals|access-date=2019-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is well [[adaptation|adapted]] to living in cold environments, and is best known for its thick, warm fur that is also used as camouflage. It has a large and very fluffy tail. In the wild, most individuals do not live past their first year but some exceptional ones survive up to 11 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;dx.doi.org&quot; /&gt; Its body length ranges from {{cvt|46|to|68|cm}}, with a generally rounded body shape to minimize the escape of [[body heat]].

The Arctic fox preys on many small creatures such as [[lemming]]s, [[vole]]s, [[ringed seal]] pups, fish, [[waterfowl]], and [[seabird]]s. It also eats [[carrion]], berries, seaweed, and insects and other small invertebrates. Arctic foxes form [[monogamy|monogamous]] pairs during the breeding season and they stay together to raise their young in complex underground dens. Occasionally, other family members may assist in raising their young. Natural predators of the Arctic fox are [[golden eagle]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flr.gov.nl.ca/wildlife/snp/programs/education/animal_facts/mammals/arctic_fox.html Arctic Fox] at Fisheries and Land Resources&lt;/ref&gt; [[arctic wolf|Arctic wolves]], [[polar bear]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/a/arctic-fox/ Arctic Fox] at National Geographic&lt;/ref&gt; [[wolverine]]s, [[red fox]]es, and [[grizzly bear]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallant|first1=D. |author2=Reid, D.G. |author3=Slough, B.G. |author4=Berteaux, D. |title=Natal den selection by sympatric arctic and red foxes on Herschel Island, Yukon, Canada|journal=Polar Biology |date=2014 |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=333–345|doi=10.1007/s00300-013-1434-1|s2cid=18744412}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;doi.org&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Noren|first1=K. |author2=Hersteinsson, P. |author3=Samelius, G. |author4=Eide, N.E. |author5=Fuglei, E. |author6=Elmhagen, B. |author7=Dalén, L. |author8=Meijer, T. |author9=Angerbjörn, A. |name-list-style=amp |title=From monogamy to complexity: social organization of arctic foxes (''Vulpes lagopus'') in contrasting ecosystems |journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=2012|volume=90|issue=9|pages=1102–1116 |doi=10.1139/z2012-077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior==
[[File:Alopex lagopus IMG 9019.JPG|thumb|left|A sleeping Arctic fox with its fluffy tail wrapped around itself and over its face]]
Arctic foxes must endure a temperature difference of up to {{cvt|90-100|C-change}} between the external environment and their internal core temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fuglesteg|first1=B. |author2=Haga, Ø.E. |name-list-style=amp |author3=Folkow, L.P. |author4=Fuglei, E. |author5=Blix, A.S. |title=Seasonal variations in basal metabolic rate, lower critical temperature and responses to temporary starvation in the arctic fox (''Alopex lagopus'') from Svalbard|journal=Polar Biology |date=2006 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=308–319|doi=10.1007/s00300-005-0054-9|s2cid=31158070}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent heat loss, the Arctic fox curls up tightly tucking its legs and head under its body and behind its furry tail. This position gives the fox the smallest surface area to volume ratio and protects the least insulated areas. Arctic foxes also stay warm by getting out of the wind and residing in their dens.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceD&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prestrud|first1=P. |s2cid=45830118|title=Adaptations by the Arctic Fox (''Alopex lagopus'') to the Polar Winter|journal=Arctic |date=1991|volume=44|issue=2|pages=132–138 |jstor=40511073|doi=10.14430/arctic1529}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot; /&gt; Although the Arctic foxes are active year-round and do not hibernate, they attempt to preserve fat by reducing their locomotor activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceD&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceE&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klir|first1=J. |last2=Heath|first2=J. |name-list-style=amp |title=An Infrared Thermographic Study of Surface Temperature in Relation to External Thermal Stress in Three Species of Foxes: The Red Fox (''Vulpes vulpes''), Arctic Fox (''Alopex lagopus''), and Kit Fox (''Vulpes macrotis'') |journal=Physiological Zoology|date=1991|volume=65|issue=5|pages=1011–1021 |jstor=30158555|doi=10.1086/physzool.65.5.30158555|s2cid=87183522}}&lt;/ref&gt; They build up their fat reserves in the autumn, sometimes increasing their body weight by more than 50%. This provides greater insulation during the winter and a source of energy when food is scarce.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA&quot; /&gt;

===Reproduction===
In the spring, the Arctic fox's attention switches to reproduction and a home for their potential offspring. They live in large dens in frost-free, slightly raised ground. These are complex systems of tunnels covering as much as {{cvt|1000|m2}} and are often in [[esker]]s, long ridges of sedimentary material deposited in formerly [[Glacier|glaciated]] regions. These dens may be in existence for many decades and are used by many generations of foxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Fox pups animals.jpg|thumb|Pups of Arctic fox with summer morph]]
Arctic foxes tend to select dens that are easily accessible with many entrances, and that are clear from snow and ice making it easier to burrow in. The Arctic fox builds and chooses dens that face southward towards the sun, which makes the den warmer. Arctic foxes prefer large, maze-like dens for predator evasion and a quick escape especially when red foxes are in the area. Natal dens are typically found in rugged terrain, which may provide more protection for the pups. But, the parents will also relocate litters to nearby dens to avoid predators. When red foxes are not in the region, Arctic foxes will use dens that the red fox previously occupied. Shelter quality is more important to the Arctic fox than the proximity of spring prey to a den.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot; /&gt;

The main prey in the tundra are lemmings, which is why the white fox is often called the &quot;lemming fox&quot;. The white fox's reproduction rates reflect the lemming population density, which cyclically fluctuates every 3–5 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;dx.doi.org&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pagh|first1=S. |last2=Hersteinsson|first2=P. |name-list-style=amp|title=Difference in diet and age structure of blue and white Arctic foxes (''Vulpes lagopus'') in the Disko Bay area, West Greenland|journal=Polar Research|date=2008|volume=27|issue=1|pages=44–51 |doi=10.1111/j.1751-8369.2008.00042.x|bibcode=2008PolRe..27...44P|s2cid=129105385}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;doi.org&quot; /&gt; When lemmings are abundant, the white fox can give birth to 18 pups, but they often do not reproduce when food is scarce. The &quot;coastal fox&quot; or blue fox lives in an environment where food availability is relatively consistent, and they will have up to 5 pups every year.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi.org&quot; /&gt;

Breeding usually takes place in April and May, and the [[gestation period]] is about 52 days. Litters may contain as many as 25 (the largest litter size in the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Carnivora]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacDonald|first=David W.|title=Biology and Conservation of Wild Canids|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-851556-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young emerge from the den when 3 to 4 weeks old and are weaned by 9 weeks of age.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA&quot; /&gt;

Arctic foxes are primarily [[monogamous]] and both parents will care for the offspring. When predators and prey are abundant, Arctic foxes are more likely to be promiscuous (exhibited in both males and females) and display more complex social structures. Larger packs of foxes consisting of breeding or non-breeding males or females can guard a single territory more proficiently to increase pup survival. When resources are scarce, competition increases and the number of foxes in a territory decreases. On the coasts of [[Svalbard]], the frequency of complex social structures is larger than inland foxes that remain monogamous due to food availability. In Scandinavia, there are more complex social structures compared to other populations due to the presence of the red fox. Also, conservationists are supplying the declining population with supplemental food. One unique case, however, is [[Iceland]] where monogamy is the most prevalent. The older offspring (1-year-olds) often remain within their parent's territory even though predators are absent and there are fewer resources, which may indicate [[kin selection]] in the fox.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi.org&quot; /&gt;

===Diet===
[[File:Fox with fish.jpg|thumb|An Arctic fox (summer morph) with [[salmon]]]]
Arctic foxes generally eat any small animal they can find, including [[lemming]]s, [[vole]]s, other rodents, [[hare]]s, [[bird]]s, [[Egg (food)|eggs]], fish, and [[carrion]]. They scavenge on carcasses left by larger predators such as wolves and [[polar bear]]s, and in times of scarcity also eat their [[feces]]. In areas where they are present, lemmings are their most common prey,&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA&quot; /&gt; and a family of foxes can eat dozens of lemmings each day. In some locations in northern Canada, a high seasonal abundance of migrating birds that breed in the area may provide an important food source. On the coast of Iceland and other islands, their diet consists predominantly of birds. During April and May, the Arctic fox also preys on [[ringed seal]] pups when the young animals are confined to a snow den and are relatively helpless. They also consume berries and seaweed, so they may be considered [[omnivore]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bockstoce2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Bockstoce, J.R.|title=Furs and frontiers in the far north: the contest among native and foreign nations for the Bering Strait fur trade |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HY6LvFMSxxwC&amp;pg=PA41|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-14921-0|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fox is a significant bird-egg predator, consuming eggs of all except the largest tundra bird species.&lt;ref name=&quot;truett&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Truett, J.C. |author2=Johnson, S.R. |title=The natural history of an Arctic oil field: development and the biota |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ELsq-yAP0XkC&amp;pg=PA161|year=2000|publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-701235-3|pages=160–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; When food is overabundant, the Arctic fox buries (caches) the surplus as a reserve.

Arctic foxes survive harsh winters and food scarcity by either hoarding food or storing body fat. Fat is deposited subcutaneously and viscerally in Arctic foxes. At the beginning of winter, the foxes have approximately 14740 kJ of energy storage from fat alone. Using the lowest BMR value measured in Arctic foxes, an average sized fox ({{cvt|3.5|kg}}) would need 471 kJ/day during the winter to survive. Arctic foxes can acquire goose eggs (from [[Snow goose|greater snow geese]] in Canada) at a rate of 2.7–7.3 eggs/h, and they store 80–97% of them. Scats provide evidence that they eat the eggs during the winter after caching. Isotope analysis shows that eggs can still be eaten after a year, and the metabolizable energy of a stored goose egg only decreases by 11% after 60 days (a fresh egg has about 816 kJ). Researchers have also noted that some eggs stored in the summer are accessed later the following spring prior to reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Careau|first1=V. |s2cid=51683546 |author2=Giroux, J.F. |author3=Gauthier, G. |author4=Berteaux, D. |name-list-style=amp |title=Surviving on cached foods — the energetics of egg-caching by Arctic foxes|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology |date=2008 |volume=86|issue=10|pages=1217–1223 |doi=10.1139/Z08-102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
The Arctic fox lives in some of the most frigid extremes on the planet, but they do not start to shiver until the temperature drops to {{cvt|-70|°C}}. Among its [[adaptation]]s for survival in the cold is its dense, multilayered [[pelage]], which provides excellent insulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Sillero-Zubiri, Michael Hoffmann and David W. Macdonald (eds.) (2004).

IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Arctic fox is the only canid whose foot pads are covered in fur. There are two genetically distinct coat color [[Polymorphism (biology)|morphs]]: white and blue.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceD&quot;/&gt; The white morph has [[seasonal camouflage]], white in winter and brown along the back with light grey around the abdomen in summer. The blue morph is often a dark blue, brown, or grey color year-round. Although the blue [[allele]] is dominant over the white allele, 99% of the Arctic fox population is the white morph.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dx.doi.org&quot;/&gt; Two similar mutations to [[MC1R]] cause the blue color and the lack of seasonal color change.&lt;ref name=Vage2005&gt;{{cite journal | title = Two cysteine substitutions in the MC1R generate the blue variant of the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) and prevent expression of the white winter coat | year = 2005| doi = 10.1016/j.peptides.2004.11.040| last1 = Våge| first1 = D.I.| last2=Fuglei| first2 = E.| last3 = Snipstad| first3 = K. | last4 = Beheim| first4 = J. | last5 = Landsem| first5 = V.M. |last6=Klungland| first6 = H. | journal = Peptides| volume = 26| issue = 10| pages = 1814–1817| pmid = 15982782| hdl = 11250/174384| s2cid = 7264542| hdl-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fur of the Arctic fox provides the best insulation of any mammal.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAPT&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/arctic44-2-132.pdf|title=Adaptations by the arctic fox to the polar winter|access-date=2015-10-08|publisher=Arctic, vol.44 no.2|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304201957/http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/arctic44-2-132.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fox has a low [[surface area to volume ratio]], as evidenced by its generally compact body shape, short muzzle and legs, and short, thick ears. Since less of its surface area is exposed to the Arctic cold, less heat escapes from its body.&lt;ref name=&quot;DECGNL&quot;&gt;[http://www.env.gov.nl.ca/env/snp/programs/education/animal_facts/mammals/arctic_fox.html Arctic Fox ''Alopex lagopus''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305031515/http://www.env.gov.nl.ca/env/snp/programs/education/animal_facts/mammals/arctic_fox.html |date=5 March 2016 }}. Department of Environment and Conservation, Government of Newfoundland and Labrador&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensory modalities===
The Arctic fox has a functional [[hearing range]] between 125&amp;nbsp;Hz–16&amp;nbsp;kHz with a sensitivity that is ≤ 60&amp;nbsp;dB in air, and an average peak sensitivity of 24&amp;nbsp;dB at 4&amp;nbsp;kHz. Overall, the Arctic foxes hearing is less sensitive than the dog and the kit fox. The Arctic fox and the kit fox have a low upper-frequency limit compared to the domestic dog and other carnivores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stansbury|first1=A. |author2=Thomas, J.A. |name-list-style=amp |author3=Stalf, C.E. |author4= Murphy, L.D. |author5=Lombardi, D. |author6=Carpenter, J. |author7=Mueller, T. |title=Behavioral audiogram of two Arctic foxes (''Vulpes lagopus'') |journal=Polar Biology |date=2014|volume=37|issue=3|pages=417–422|doi=10.1007/s00300-014-1446-5|s2cid=17154503}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arctic fox can easily hear lemmings burrowing under 4-5 inches of snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perry|first1=Richard|title=The Polar Worlds|date=1973|publisher=Taplinger Pub.

The Arctic fox also has a keen sense of smell. They can smell carcasses that are often left by polar bears anywhere from {{cvt|10|to|40|km}}. It is possible that they use their sense of smell to also track down polar bears. Additionally, Arctic foxes can smell and find frozen lemmings under {{cvt|46|–|77|cm}} of snow, and can detect a subnivean seal lair under {{cvt|150|cm}} of snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lai|first1=S. |last2=Bety|first2=J. |last3=Berteaux|first3=D. |name-list-style=amp |title=Spatio–temporal hotspots of satellite– tracked arctic foxes reveal a large detection range in a mammalian predator|journal=Movement Ecology |date=2015 |volume=3 |issue=37 |pages=37|doi=10.1186/s40462-015-0065-2|pmid=26568827|pmc=4644628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physiology===
[[File:Arctic fox lying in grass - DPLA - aec2d3501ce813f648ec3211f2264306.jpg|left|thumb|Arctic fox lying in grass. A fox's thick winter coat helps keep its body temperature near {{cvt|100|F|order=flip}}. Foxes also have fur on the soles of their feet and reduced blood flow to their legs to help keep them warm.]]
The Arctic fox contains advantageous genes to overcome extreme cold and starvation periods. [[Transcriptome]] [[sequencing]] has identified two genes that are under [[positive selection]]: [[Glycolipid transfer protein]] domain containing 1 (GLTPD1) and [[V-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 2]] (AKT2). GLTPD1 is involved in the [[fatty acid metabolism]], while AKT2 pertains to the glucose metabolism and insulin signaling.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceF&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kumar|first1=V. |author2=Kutschera, V.E. |author3=Nilsson, M.A. |author4=Janke, A. |name-list-style=amp |title=Genetic signatures of adaptation revealed from transcriptome sequencing of Arctic and red foxes |journal=BMC Genomics |date=2015 |volume=16 |pages=585 |doi=10.1186/s12864-015-1724-9 |pmid=26250829 |pmc=4528681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average mass specific [[Basal metabolic rate|BMR]] and total BMR are 37% and 27% lower in the winter than the summer. The Arctic fox decreases its BMR via metabolic depression in the winter to conserve fat storage and minimize energy requirements. According to the most recent data, the lower critical temperature of the Arctic fox is at {{cvt|−7|C}} in the winter and {{cvt|5|C}} in the summer. It was commonly believed that the Arctic fox had a lower critical temperature below {{cvt|−40|C}}. However, some scientists have concluded that this statistic is not accurate since it was never tested using the proper equipment.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;

About 22% of the total body surface area of the Arctic fox dissipates heat readily compared to red foxes at 33%. The regions that have the greatest heat loss are the nose, ears, legs, and feet, which is useful in the summer for thermal heat regulation. Also, the Arctic fox has a beneficial mechanism in their nose for evaporative cooling like dogs, which keeps the brain cool during the summer and exercise.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceE&quot;/&gt; The [[thermal conductivity]] of Arctic fox fur in the summer and winter is the same; however, the thermal conductance of the Arctic fox in the winter is lower than the summer since fur thickness increases by 140%. In the summer, the thermal conductance of the Arctic foxes body is 114% higher than the winter, but their body core temperature is constant year-round.

One way that Arctic foxes regulate their body temperature is by utilizing a countercurrent heat exchange in the blood of their legs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; Arctic foxes can constantly keep their feet above the tissue freezing point ({{cvt|−1|C}}) when standing on cold substrates without losing mobility or feeling pain. They do this by increasing vasodilation and blood flow to a capillary rete in the pad surface, which is in direct contact with the snow rather than the entire foot. They selectively vasoconstrict blood vessels in the center of the foot pad, which conserves energy and minimizes heat loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceE&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceG&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Henshaw|first1=R. |last2=Underwood|first2=L. |last3=Casey|first3=T. |title=Peripheral Thermoregulation: Foot Temperature in Two Arctic Canines |journal=Science |date=1972|volume=175 |issue=4025 |pages=988–990 |jstor=1732725 |bibcode=1972Sci...175..988H |doi=10.1126/science.175.4025.988 |pmid=5009400|s2cid=23126602}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arctic foxes maintain the temperature in their paws independently from the core temperature.

It was originally described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition of ''Systema Naturae'']] in 1758 as ''Canis lagopus''. The [[type specimen]] was recovered from [[Lapland (Sweden)|Lapland]], [[Sweden]]. The generic name ''vulpes'' is [[Latin]] for &quot;fox&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lariviere&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Larivière, S. |year=2002|title=''Vulpes zerda''|journal=Mammalian Species |pages=1–5 |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/pdf/714_Vulpes_zerda.pdf|doi=10.1644/1545-1410(2002)714&lt;0001:VZ&gt;2.0.CO;2|issue=714|s2cid=198968737 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223193851/http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/pdf/714_Vulpes_zerda.pdf|archive-date=23 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific name ''lagopus'' is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] λαγώς (''lagōs'', &quot;[[hare]]&quot;) and πούς (''pous'', &quot;foot&quot;), referring to the hair on its feet similar to those found in cold-climate species of hares.&lt;ref name=&quot;audet&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Audet, A.M. |author2=Robbins, C.B. |author3=Larivière, S. |name-list-style=amp |year=2002|title=''Alopex lagopus''|journal=Mammalian Species |issue=713 |pages=1–10 |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/pdf/713_Alopex_lagopus.pdf|doi=10.1644/1545-1410(2002)713&lt;0001:AL&gt;2.0.CO;2|s2cid=198969139 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608042809/http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/pdf/713_Alopex_lagopus.pdf|archive-date=8 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at the most recent phylogeny, the Arctic fox and the red fox (''Vulpes vulpes'') diverged approximately 3.17MYA. Additionally, the Arctic fox diverged from its sister group, the kit fox (''Vulpes macrotis''), at about 0.9MYA.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceF&quot;/&gt;

===Origins===
The origins of the Arctic fox have been described by the &quot;out of Tibet&quot; hypothesis. On the [[Tibetan Plateau]], [[fossil]]s of the extinct ancestral Arctic fox (''[[Vulpes qiuzhudingi]]'') from the early Pliocene (5.08–3.6 MYA) were found along with many other precursors of modern mammals that evolved during the [[Pliocene]] (5.3–2.6 MYA). It is believed that this ancient fox is the ancestor of the modern Arctic fox. Globally, the Pliocene was about 2–3&amp;nbsp;°C warmer than today, and the Arctic during the summer in the mid-Pliocene was 8&amp;nbsp;°C warmer. By using stable carbon and oxygen [[isotope]] analysis of fossils, researchers claim that the Tibetan Plateau experienced tundra-like conditions during the Pliocene and harbored cold-adapted mammals that later spread to North America and Eurasia during the [[Pleistocene|Pleistocene Epoch]] (2.6 million-11,700 years ago).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=X. |author2=Wang, Y. |name-list-style=amp |author3=Li, Q. |author4=Tseng, Z.J. |author5=Takeuchi, G.T. |author6=Deng, T. |author7=Xie, G. |author8=Chang, M.M. |author9=Wang, N. |title=Cenozoic vertebrate evolution and paleoenvironment in Tibetan Plateau: Progress and prospects |journal=Gondwana Research |date=2015 |volume=27 |issue=4|pages=1335–1354 |doi=10.1016/j.gr.2014.10.014 |bibcode=2015GondR..27.1335W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subspecies===
[[File:Blue fox on St Paul Island by Ryan Mong USFWS.jpg|thumb|Blue phase, Pribilof Islands]] 
Besides the nominate [[subspecies]], the common Arctic fox, ''V. l. lagopus'', four other subspecies of this fox have been described:
* [[Bering Sea#Islands|Bering]] Islands Arctic fox, ''V. l. beringensis''
* Greenland Arctic fox, ''V. l. foragoapusis''
* Iceland Arctic fox, ''V. l. fuliginosus''
* [[Pribilof Islands]] Arctic fox, ''V. l. pribilofensis''

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:ArcticFoxesLyd.jpg|thumb|The Arctic fox's seasonal furs, summer (top), &quot;blue&quot; (middle), and winter (bottom)]]
The Arctic fox has a circumpolar distribution and occurs in Arctic tundra habitats in northern Europe, northern Asia, and North America. Its range includes Greenland, Iceland, Fennoscandia, [[Svalbard]], [[Jan Mayen]] (where it was hunted to extinction)&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180521021903/https://www.hurtigruten.us/must-read-articles/spitsbergen/the-isolated-beauty-of-jan-mayen/ The isolated beauty of Jan Mayen]. Hurtigruten US&lt;/ref&gt; and other islands in the [[Barents Sea]], northern Russia, islands in the [[Bering Sea]], [[Alaska]], and Canada as far south as [[Hudson Bay]]. In the late 19th century, it was introduced into the [[Aleutian Islands]] southwest of Alaska. However, the population on the Aleutian Islands is currently being eradicated in conservation efforts to preserve the local bird population.&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt; It mostly inhabits tundra and [[pack ice]], but is also present in Canadian [[taiga|boreal forest]]s (northeastern [[Alberta]], northern [[Saskatchewan]], northern [[Manitoba]], [[Northern Ontario]], [[Nord-du-Québec|Northern Quebec]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/what-we-do/resource-centre/featured-species/mammals/arctic-fox.html Arctic fox]. Nature Conservancy Canada&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kenai Peninsula]] in Alaska. They are found at elevations up to {{cvt|3000|m}} above sea level and have been seen on sea ice close to the [[North Pole]].&lt;ref name=Feldhamer&gt;{{cite book |author1=Feldhamer, George A. |author2=Thompson, B.C. |author3=Chapman, J.A. |title=Wild Mammals of North America: Biology, Management, and Conservation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-xQalfqP7BcC&amp;pg=PA540 |year=2003 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-7416-1 |pages=511–540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arctic fox is the only land mammal native to Iceland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iceland&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iww.is/pages/alife/biglf.html |title=Wildlife |year=2000 |work=Iceland Worldwide |publisher=iww.is |access-date=22 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414112114/http://www.iww.is/pages/alife/biglf.html |archive-date=14 April 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It came to the isolated [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] island at the end of the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]], walking over the frozen sea. [[The Arctic Fox Center]] in [[Súðavík]] contains an exhibition on the Arctic fox and conducts studies on the influence of tourism on the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arcticfoxcenter.com/ |title=The Arctic Fox Center |access-date=19 May 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210085613/http://arcticfoxcenter.com/ |archive-date=10 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its range during the last [[ice age]] was much more extensive than it is now, and [[fossil]] remains of the Arctic fox have been found over much of northern Europe and Siberia.&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt;

The color of the fox's coat also determines where they are most likely to be found. The white morph mainly lives inland and blends in with the snowy tundra, while the blue morph occupies the coasts because its dark color blends in with the cliffs and rocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;dx.doi.org&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Migrations and travel===
During the winter, 95.5% of Arctic foxes utilize commuting trips, which remain within the fox's home range. Commuting trips in Arctic foxes last less than 3 days and occur between 0–2.9 times a month. Nomadism is found in 3.4% of the foxes, and loop migrations (where the fox travels to a new range, then returns to its home range) are the least common at 1.1%. Arctic foxes in Canada that undergo nomadism and migrations voyage from the Canadian archipelago to Greenland and northwestern Canada. The duration and distance traveled between males and females is not significantly different.

Arctic foxes closer to goose colonies (located at the coasts) are less likely to migrate. Meanwhile, foxes experiencing low-density lemming populations are more likely to make sea ice trips. Residency is common in the Arctic fox population so that they can maintain their territories. Migratory foxes have a mortality rate &gt;3 times higher than resident foxes. Nomadic behavior becomes more common as the foxes age.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lai|first1=S. |last2=Bety|first2=J. |last3=Berteaux|first3=D. |title=Movement tactics of a mobile predator in a meta-ecosystem with fluctuating resources: the arctic fox in the High Arctic |journal=Oikos |date=2017|volume=126|issue=7|pages=937–947|doi=10.1111/oik.03948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She then moved on to [[Ellesmere Island]] in northern [[Canada]], covering a total recorded distance of {{cvt|3,506|km}} in 76 days, before her [[GPS tracker]] stopped working. She averaged just over {{cvt|46|km}} a day, and managed as much as {{cvt|155|km}} in a single day.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcepic&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Scientists 'speechless' at Arctic fox's epic trek |work=BBC News |date=July 2019 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-48824181 |access-date=1 July 2019 |ref=bbcepic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation status==
[[File:Lagopusskull.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of skull by [[St. George Mivart]], 1890]]
The Arctic fox has been assessed as [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] since 2004.&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt; However, the Scandinavian mainland population is acutely endangered, despite being legally protected from hunting and persecution for several decades. The estimate of the adult population in all of Norway, Sweden, and Finland is fewer than 200 individuals.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt; Of these, especially in Finland, the Arctic fox is even classified as [[Critically Endangered|critically endangered]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Naali ''Alopex lagopus''. | date= 2011-08-01 | publisher= Metsähallitus |url=http://www.metsa.fi/sivustot/metsa/fi/Luonnonsuojelu/Lajitjaluontotyypit/Uhanalaisetelaimet/Naali/Sivut/Naali.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214233500/http://www.metsa.fi/sivustot/metsa/fi/Luonnonsuojelu/Lajitjaluontotyypit/Uhanalaisetelaimet/Naali/Sivut/Naali.aspx |archive-date=2011-12-14  | access-date = 2022-08-11 | language = fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; because even though the animal was pacified in Finland since 1940, the population has not recovered despite that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Olli Järvinen &amp; Kaarina Miettinen | title= Sammuuko suuri suku? – Luonnon puolustamisen biologiaa | pages= 95, 190 | location= Vantaa | publisher= Suomen luonnonsuojelun tuki | year= 1987 | isbn= 951-9381-20-1 | language = fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the populations of Arctic fox have been carefully studied and inventoried in places such as the [[Vindelfjällens Nature Reserve]] (Sweden), which has the Arctic fox as its symbol.

The abundance of the Arctic fox tends to fluctuate in a cycle along with the population of lemmings and [[vole]]s (a 3- to 4-year cycle).&lt;ref name=truett/&gt; The populations are especially vulnerable during the years when the prey population crashes, and uncontrolled [[Animal trapping|trapping]] has almost eradicated two subpopulations.&lt;ref name=NOAA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/report12/arctic_fox.html |title=Arctic fox (''Vulpes lagopus'') |author1=Angerbjörn, A. |author2=Berteaux, D. |author3=I.R. |date=2012 |work=Arctic report card: Update for 2012 |publisher=NOAA Arctic Research Program |access-date=6 October 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011195501/http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/report12/arctic_fox.html |archive-date=11 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alopex lagopus 05 MWNH 289.JPG|thumb|Skull]]

The pelts of Arctic foxes with a slate-blue coloration were especially valuable. They were transported to various previously fox-free [[Aleutian Island]]s during the 1920s. The program was successful in terms of increasing the population of blue foxes, but their predation of [[Aleutian cackling goose|Aleutian Canada geese]] conflicted with the goal of preserving that species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbYL7JNnMNIC&amp;pg=PA42|page=42|title=Ecology of North America|author=Bolen, Eric G. |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|year=1998|isbn=978-0-471-13156-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arctic fox is losing ground to the larger [[red fox]]. This has been attributed to [[climate change]]—the camouflage value of its lighter coat decreases with less snow cover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hannah2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Hannah, Lee|title=Climate Change Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Vvqw2gdk9QC&amp;pg=PA63|year=2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-374182-0|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red foxes dominate where their ranges begin to overlap by killing Arctic foxes and their kits.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacdonaldSillero-Zubiri2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Macdonald, David Whyte|author2=Sillero-Zubiri, Claudio|title=The biology and conservation of wild canids|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vrgow9ERQeIC&amp;pg=PA10|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-851556-2|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative explanation of the red fox's gains involves the [[gray wolf]]. Historically, it has kept red fox numbers down, but as the wolf has been hunted to near [[extinction]] in much of its former range, the red fox population has grown larger, and it has taken over the niche of [[Apex predator|top predator]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} In areas of northern Europe, programs are in place that allow the hunting of red foxes in the Arctic fox's previous range.

As with many other game species, the best sources of historical and large-scale population data are hunting bag records and questionnaires. Several potential sources of error occur in such data collections.&lt;ref name=G_and_E&gt;{{cite book |author1=Garrott, R. A.  |author2=Eberhardt, L. E. | year = 1987 | chapter = Arctic fox | editor = Novak, M. | title = Wild furbearer management and conservation in North America | pages = 395–406|isbn=978-0774393652|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, numbers vary widely between years due to the large population fluctuations. However, the total population of the Arctic fox must be in the order of several hundred thousand animals.&lt;ref name=Tannerfeldt&gt;{{cite book | author = Tannerfeldt, M. | year = 1997 | title = Population fluctuations and life history consequences in the Arctic fox. | publisher = Dissertation, Stockholm University | location = Stockholm, Sweden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world population of Arctic foxes is thus not endangered, but two Arctic fox subpopulations are. One is on [[Medny Island]] ([[Commander Islands]], Russia), which was reduced by some 85–90%, to around 90 animals, as a result of [[mange]] caused by an ear tick introduced by dogs in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Goltsman&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goltsman, M.| year = 1996 | last2 = Kruchenkova | first2 = E.

The other threatened population is the one in [[Fennoscandia]] (Norway, Sweden, Finland, and [[Kola Peninsula]]). This population decreased drastically around the start of the 20th century as a result of extreme fur prices, which caused severe hunting also during population lows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lönnberg&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Lönnberg, E. | year = 1927 | title = Fjällrävsstammen i Sverige 1926 | publisher = Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences | location = Uppsala, Sweden}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population has remained at a low density for more than 90 years, with additional reductions during the last decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Angerbjörn&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1995 | title = Dynamics of the Arctic fox population in Sweden | journal = Annales Zoologici Fennici | volume = 32 | pages = 55–68 | url = http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:234717 | author = Angerbjörn, A. | display-authors = etal | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140224040113/http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:234717 | archive-date = 24 February 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total population estimate for 1997 is around 60 adults in Sweden, 11 adults in Finland, and 50 in Norway. From Kola, there are indications of a similar situation, suggesting a population of around 20 adults. The Fennoscandian population thus numbers around 140 breeding adults. Even after local lemming peaks, the Arctic fox population tends to collapse back to levels dangerously close to nonviability.&lt;ref name=Tannerfeldt/&gt;

The Arctic fox is classed as a &quot;prohibited new organism&quot; under New Zealand's [[Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996]], preventing it from being imported into the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1996/0030/latest/DLM386556.html#DLM386556|title=Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 2003 – Schedule 2 Prohibited new organisms|publisher=New Zealand Government|access-date=26 January 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616104517/http://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1996/0030/latest/DLM386556.html#DLM386556|archive-date=16 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{US culture}}

'''American folklore''' encompasses the [[folklore]]s that have evolved in the present-day United States since Europeans arrived in the 16th century. While it contains much in the way of Native American tradition, it is not wholly identical to the tribal beliefs of any community of native people.

Folklore consists of [[legend]]s, music, [[oral history]], [[proverb]]s, [[joke]]s, [[popular belief]]s, [[fairy tale]]s, stories, [[tall tale]]s, and [[Convention (norm)|customs]] that are the [[tradition]]s of a [[culture]], [[subculture]], or group. It is also the set of practices through which those expressive genres are shared.

==Native American folklore==
[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultures are rich in [[myth]]s and [[legend]]s that explain natural phenomena and the relationship between humans and the spirit world. According to [[Barre Toelken]], feathers, beadwork, dance steps and music, the events in a story, the shape of a dwelling, or items of traditional food can be viewed as icons of cultural meaning.&lt;ref name=Barre&gt;[[Toelken, Barre]].[http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&amp;context=usupress_pubs ''The Anguish of Snails'', Utah State University Press, 2003] {{ISBN|0-87421-555-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native American cultures are numerous and diverse. Though some neighboring cultures hold similar beliefs, others can be quite different from one another. The most common myths are the [[creation myths]], which tell a story to explain how the earth was formed, and where humans and other beings came from. Others may include explanations about the Sun, Moon, constellations, specific animals, seasons, and weather. This is one of the ways that many tribes have kept, and continue to keep, their cultures alive; these stories are told as a way of preserving and transmitting the nation, tribe, or band's particular beliefs, history, customs, spirituality, and traditional way of life. According to Barre Toelken, &quot;Stories not only entertain but also embody Native behavioral and ethical values.&quot;&lt;ref name=Barre/&gt;

Although individual tribes have their own sacred beliefs and myths, many stories have much in common. Myths about floods are almost universal amongst Plains tribes, stories of a flooded earth being restored. There are many &quot;hero stories&quot; immortalising the adventures of heroes with supernatural powers, who right wrongs and defeat evils. Animal tales are common, some explaining how features of certain animals occurred, some using animal characters for narration, and others using animals symbolically. There are also myths where supernatural beings appear in the form of animals, with the bear, elk, eagle, owl, and snake frequently referred to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Native American Mythology &amp; Legends – Legends of America |url=https://www.legendsofamerica.com/native-american-legends/ |access-date=2022-08-25 |website=www.legendsofamerica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding myths==
The founding of the United States is often surrounded by legends and tall tales. Many stories have developed since the founding long ago to become a part of America's folklore and cultural awareness, and non-Native American folklore especially includes any narrative which has contributed to the shaping of [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] and belief systems. These narratives have varying levels of historical accuracy; the veracity of the stories is not a determining factor.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===Christopher Columbus===
[[Christopher Columbus]], as a hero and symbol to the then-immigrants, is an important figure in the body of American myth. His status, not unlike most American icons, is representative not of his own accomplishments, but the self-perception of the society which chose him as a hero. Having effected a separation from England and its cultural icons, the United States was left without history—or heroes on which to base a shared sense of their social selves. [[Washington Irving]] was instrumental in popularizing Columbus. His version of Columbus' life, published in 1829, was more a romance than a biography.&lt;ref name=xroads/&gt; The book was very popular, and contributed to an image of the discoverer as a solitary individual who challenged the unknown sea, as triumphant Americans contemplated the dangers and promise of their own wilderness [[frontier]]. As a consequence of his vision and audacity, there was now a land free from kings, a vast continent for new beginnings. In the years following the Revolution the poetic device &quot;Columbia&quot; was used as a symbol of both Columbus and America. King's College of New York changed its name in 1792 to Columbia, and the new capital in Washington was subtitled [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]].&lt;ref name=xroads&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~CAP/COLUMBUS/col3.html |title=''Columbus in History'' |publisher=Xroads.virginia.edu |access-date=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jamestown===
{{Main|Pocahontas}}
In May 1607, the [[Susan Constant]], the [[Discovery (1602 ship)|Discovery]], and the [[Godspeed (ship)|Godspeed]] sailed through Chesapeake Bay and thirty miles up the James River settlers built [[Jamestown, Virginia]], England's first permanent colony. Too late in the season to plant crops, many were not accustomed to manual labor. Within a few months, some settlers died of famine and disease. Only thirty-eight made it through their first year in the New World. [[John Smith (explorer)|Captain John Smith]], a pirate turned gentleman turned the settlers into foragers and successful traders with the Native Americans, who taught the English how to plant corn and other crops. Smith led expeditions to explore the regions surrounding Jamestown, and it was during one of these that the chief of the Powhatan Native Americans captured Smith. According to an account Smith published in 1624, he was going to be put to death until the chief's daughter, [[Pocahontas]], saved him. From this the legend of Pocahontas sprang forth, becoming part of American folklore, children's books, and movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGeehan |first=John R. |url=http://www.netplaces.com/american-history/english-french-and-dutch-influences/jamestown-settlement.htm |title=McGeehan, John R., Jamestown Settlement |publisher=Netplaces.com |date=2011-02-23 |access-date=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pilgrims===
[[File:Plymouth Rock Monument cropped.JPG|right|thumb|Plymouth Rock Monument designed for the Tercentenary (1920)]]
[[Plymouth Rock]] is the traditional site of disembarkation of [[William Bradford (Plymouth governor)|William Bradford]] and the [[Mayflower]] Pilgrims who founded [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620, and an important symbol in American history. There are no contemporary references to the Pilgrims' landing on a rock at Plymouth. The first written reference to the Pilgrims landing on a rock is found 121&amp;nbsp;years after they landed. The Rock, or one traditionally identified as it, has long been memorialized on the shore of Plymouth Harbor in Plymouth, Massachusetts. The holiday of [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] is said to have begun with the [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]] in 1621.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aspen Design, Westbrook, CT |url=http://www.pilgrimhall.org/f_thanks.htm |title=Pilgrim Hall Museum |publisher=Pilgrimhall.org |date=2012-11-08 |access-date=2012-12-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620184539/http://pilgrimhall.org/f_thanks.htm |archive-date=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had come to America to escape religious persecution, but then nearly starved to death. Some friendly Native Americans, including [[Squanto]], helped the Pilgrims survive through the first winter. The perseverance of the Pilgrims is celebrated during the annual Thanksgiving festival.

===George Washington===
[[George Washington]] (February 22, 1732 – December 14, 1799), the country's first president, is the most preeminent of American historical and folkloric figures, as he holds the place of &quot;[[Pater Patriae]]&quot;. Apocryphal stories about Washington's childhood include a claim that he skipped a silver dollar across the [[Rappahannock River]] at [[Ferry Farm]]. Another tale claims that as a young child, Washington chopped down his father's cherry tree. His angry father confronted the young Washington, who proclaimed &quot;I cannot tell a lie&quot; and admitted to the transgression, thus illuminating his honesty. Parson [[Mason Locke Weems]] mentions the first citation of this legend in his 1806 book, ''The Life of George Washington: With Curious Anecdotes, Equally Honorable to Himself and Exemplary to His Young Countrymen''. This anecdote cannot be independently verified. [[Mark Twain|Samuel Clemens]], also known as Mark Twain, is also known to have spread the story while lecturing, personalizing it by adding &quot;I have a higher and greater standard of principle. Washington could not lie. I can lie but I won't.&quot;{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===Patrick Henry===
[[Patrick Henry]] (May 29, 1736 – June 6, 1799) was an attorney, planter and politician who became known as an orator during the movement for independence in Virginia in the 1770s. Patrick Henry is best known for the speech he made in the House of Burgesses on March 23, 1775, in [[St. John's Episcopal Church (Richmond, Virginia)|Saint John's Church]] in Richmond, Virginia. With the House undecided on whether to mobilize for military action against the encroaching British military force, Henry argued in favor of mobilization. Forty-two years later, Henry's first biographer, William Wirt, working from oral histories, tried to reconstruct what Henry said. According to Wirt, Henry ended his speech with words that have since become immortalized: &quot;I know not what course others may take; but as for me, Give me Liberty, or give me Death!&quot; The crowd, by Wirt's account, jumped up and shouted &quot;To Arms! To Arms!&quot;. For 160&amp;nbsp;years Wirt's account was taken at face value. In the 1970s, historians began to question the authenticity of Wirt's reconstruction.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

[[File:Betsy Ross sewing.jpg|thumb|Betsy Ross sewing]]

===Betsy Ross===
[[Betsy Ross]] (January 1, 1752 – January 30, 1836) is widely credited with making the first American flag. There is, however, no credible historical evidence that the story is true. Research conducted by the [[National Museum of American History]] notes that the story of Betsy Ross making the first American flag for General George Washington entered into American consciousness about the time of the 1876 centennial celebrations. In the 2008 book ''The Star-Spangled Banner: The Making of an American Icon'', Smithsonian experts point out that accounts of the event appealed to Americans eager for stories about the revolution and its heroes and heroines. Betsy Ross was promoted as a patriotic role model for young girls and a symbol of women's contributions to American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=“God, Home, and Country”: Women, Historical Memory, and National Identity in English Canada and the United States |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02722011.2018.1472946 |access-date=2022-07-02 |website=login.proxy.lib.wayne.edu |doi=10.1080/02722011.2018.1472946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Revolutionary War heroes who became figures of American folklore include: [[Benedict Arnold]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Nathan Hale]], [[John Hancock]], [[John Paul Jones]] and [[Francis Marion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-swamp-fox-157330429/|title=The Swamp Fox|last=Crawford|first=Amy|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=2019-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tall Tales==
The [[tall tale]] is a fundamental element of American folk literature. The tall tale's origins are seen in the bragging contests that often occurred when men of the [[American frontier]] gathered. A tall tale is a story with unbelievable elements, relayed as if it were true and factual. Some such stories are exaggerations of actual events; others are completely fictional tales set in a familiar setting, such as the American Old West, or the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. They are usually humorous or good-natured. The line between myth and tall tale is distinguished primarily by age; many myths exaggerate the exploits of their heroes, but in tall tales, the exaggeration looms large, to the extent of becoming the whole of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Paquette|first=Dan|title=LibGuides: ENG 225 - Children's Literature (Fairy Tales, Folklore, Myths, and Legends): Definitions|url=https://libguides.stcc.edu/c.php?g=886516&amp;p=6370591|access-date=2021-07-21|website=libguides.stcc.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Based on historical figures===
* [[Johnny Appleseed|John Chapman]] (September 26, 1774 – March 18, 1845), widely known as Johnny Appleseed, was an American pioneer nurseryman who introduced apple trees to large parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. He became an American legend while still alive, largely because of his kind and generous ways, and the symbolic importance he attributed to apples. Johnny Appleseed is remembered in American popular culture by his traveling song or Swedenborgian hymn (&quot;The Lord is good to me...&quot;).
* [[Daniel Boone]] (November 2, 1734 [O.S. October 22] – September 26, 1820) was an American pioneer, explorer, and frontiersman whose frontier exploits made him one of the first folk heroes of the United States.
* [[Davy Crockett]] (August 17, 1786 – March 6, 1836) was a 19th-century American folk hero, frontiersman, soldier and politician. He is commonly referred to in popular culture by the epithet, &quot;King of the Wild Frontier&quot;. He represented Tennessee in the U.S. House of Representatives, served in the [[Texas Revolution]], and died at the [[Battle of the Alamo]].
* [[Mike Fink]] (c. 1770/1780 – c. 1823) called &quot;king of the keelboaters&quot;, was a semi-legendary brawler and river boatman who exemplified the tough and hard-drinking men who ran keelboats up and down the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] Rivers.
* Martha Jane Canary (May 1, 1852 – August 1, 1903), better known as [[Calamity Jane]], was an American frontierswoman, and professional scout best known for her claim of being an acquaintance of [[Wild Bill Hickok]]. She is said to have also exhibited kindness and compassion, especially to the sick and needy. It was from her that [[Bret Harte]] took his famous character of Cherokee Sal in ''The Luck of Roaring Camp''.
* [[Jigger Johnson]] (1871–1935), was a [[lumberjack]] and [[log driving|log driver]] from northern [[New England]] who is known for his numerous off-the-job exploits, such as catching [[bobcats]] alive with his bare hands, and drunken brawls.&lt;ref&gt;''Appalachia'' Appalachian Mountain Club, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monahan, Robert. &quot;Jigger Johnson&quot;, ''New Hampshire Profiles magazine'', Northeast Publications, Concord, New Hampshire, April, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] was an African-American railroad worker who is said to have worked as a &quot;steel-driving man&quot;—a man tasked with hammering a steel drill into rock to make holes for explosives to blast the rock away in constructing a railroad tunnel. According to legend, John Henry's prowess as a steel-driver was measured in a race against a steam-powered hammer, which he won, only to die in victory with his hammer in his hand and his heart giving out from stress. The &quot;Ballad of John Henry&quot; is a musical rendition of his story.
* [[Molly Pitcher]] was a nickname given to a woman said to have fought in the American Battle of Monmouth, who is generally believed to have been [[Mary Hays (American Revolutionary War)|Mary Hays]]. Since various Molly Pitcher tales grew in the telling, many historians regard Molly Pitcher as folklore rather than history, or suggest that Molly Pitcher may be a composite image inspired by the actions of a number of real women. The name itself may have originated as a nickname given to women who carried water to men on the battlefield during the war.

Other historical figures include Titanic survivor [[Margaret Brown|Molly Brown]], Wild West showman [[Buffalo Bill|Buffalo Bill Cody]], and sharpshooter [[Annie Oakley]].

===Fictional characters===
* [[Paul Bunyan]] is a lumberjack figure in North American folklore and tradition. One of the most famous and popular North American folklore heroes, he is usually described as a giant as well as a lumberjack of unusual skill, and is often accompanied in stories by his animal companion, [[Babe the Blue Ox]]. The character originated in folktales circulated among lumberjacks in the Northeastern United States and eastern Canada, first appearing in print in a story published by Northern Michigan journalist James MacGillivray in 1906.
* [[Cordwood Pete]] is said to be the younger brother of legendary lumberjack Paul Bunyan.
* The [[Lone Ranger]] is a fictional hero of the west who fought raiders and robbers in the Texas area. The sole survivor of a group of six rangers, he set out to bring the criminals who killed his brother to justice. The Lone Ranger is said to have been based on [[Bass Reeves]] by Historian Art Burton but that is in dispute.{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}}
* [[Johnny Kaw]] is a mythical Kansas settler whose exploits created elements of the Kansas landscape and helped establish wheat and sunflowers as major crops. The character dates to the 1955 centennial of Kansas and has been explored in numerous books.
* [[John the Conqueror]] also known as High John the Conqueror, and many other folk variants, is a folk hero from African-American folklore. John the Conqueror was an African prince who was sold as a slave in the Americas. Despite his enslavement, his spirit was never broken and he survived in folklore as a sort of a trickster figure, because of the tricks he played to evade his masters. Joel Chandler Harris's 'Br'er Rabbit' of the Uncle Remus stories is said to be patterned after High John the Conqueror.
* [[Pecos Bill]] is an American cowboy, apocryphally immortalized in numerous tall tales of the Old West during American westward expansion into the Southwest of Texas, New Mexico, Southern California, and Arizona
[[File:MOLLY PITCHER. (Ten American Girls from History 1917).jpg|thumb|upright|MOLLY PITCHER. (Ten American Girls from History 1917)]]
* [[Captain Stormalong]] was an American folk hero and the subject of numerous nautical-themed tall tales originating in Massachusetts. Stormalong was said to be a sailor and a giant, some 30&amp;nbsp;feet tall; he was the master of a huge clipper ship known in various sources as either the Courser or the Tuscarora, a ship so tall that it had hinged masts to avoid catching on the moon.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

==Legendary and folkloric creatures==
*[[Bigfoot]], also known as &quot;Sasquatch&quot;, is the name given to an ape-like creature that some believe inhabit mostly forests in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of, and throughout the entirety of, North America. Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, [[bipedalism|bipedal]] humanoid, although descriptions vary depending on location. The height range is about 6 to 10 feet tall with black, dark brown, or dark reddish hair.&lt;ref name=&quot;skepdic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/bigfoot.html |title=Bigfoot [a.k.a.

Among these reporters are veterans, campers, hikers, explorers, hunters, and more. There are several websites, podcasts and organizations related to Bigfoot.
* [[Champ (cryptozoology)|Champ]] is the name given to a reputed lake monster living in [[Lake Champlain]], a natural freshwater lake in North America. The lake crosses the [[Canada-United States border|U.S.–Canada border]], located partially in the Canadian province of [[Quebec]] and partially in the U.S. states of [[Vermont]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]. There is no scientific evidence for Champ's existence, though there have been over 300 reported sightings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2011-07-19|title=Champ, the Lake Champlain Monster|url=https://www.lakechamplainregion.com/heritage/champ|access-date=2021-11-29|website=Lake Champlain Region|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Punxsutawney Phil]] is a semi-mythical groundhog central to the most well-known [[Groundhog Day]] ceremony, a [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] superstition that claims to predict the arrival of spring. According to tradition, the same groundhog has made predictions ever since the 1800s.
* [[Jersey Devil|The Jersey Devil]] is a legendary creature said to inhabit the [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|Pine Barrens]] of [[South Jersey|Southern New Jersey]] in the United States. The creature is often described as a flying biped with hooves, but there are many different variations. The most common description is that of a kangaroo-like creature with the face of a horse, the head of a dog, leathery bat-like wings, horns, small arms with clawed hands, red eyes, cloven hooves and a forked tail. It has been reported to move quickly, as to avoid human contact, and often is described as emitting a &quot;blood-curdling scream&quot;.&lt;ref name=mccloy&gt;''The Jersey Devil'', by James F.

Mother Leed is said to be a witch and her 13th child was born the Devil. It soon grew wings and hooves, killed the midwife, and took off into the night.
* [[White Lady (ghost)|The White Lady]] is a type of female ghost reportedly seen in rural areas and associated with some local legend of tragedy. Common to many of them is the theme of losing or being betrayed by a husband or fiancé. They are often associated with an individual family line or said to be a harbinger of death, similar to a [[banshee]].
* [[Mothman]] is a mythical creature from [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia]] described as a large humanoid with glowing red eyes on its face and large bird-like wings with fur covering its body. Mothman has been blamed for the collapse of the [[Silver Bridge]].
* The [[Hodag]] is a mythical beast that is said to inhabit the forests of Northern [[Wisconsin]], particularly around the city of [[Rhinelander, Wisconsin|Rhinelander]]. The Hodag has a reptilian body with the horns of a bull and is said to have a penchant for mischief.
*Old Black Eyes is a spectral hound said to frequent an area known as the Baker Rocks, located near the top of the [[Black Mountains (North Carolina)|Black Mountains]] of [[North Carolina]]. Old Black Eyes is said to be the spirit of Jim Baker, who lived at the rocks and was regarded as a witch with supernatural powers by the local mountain people. According to legend, Jim Baker performed some sort of ritual at an old Indian cemetery, near the Black Mountains, where he proceeded to sell his soul to the [[Devil]]. The Devil proceeded to turn Baker's pupils &quot;unnaturally black&quot; as a sign of their deal and hell's claim on his soul. Upon his death, Baker was said to take the spirit of a &quot;devil dog&quot;, identifiable by the large black pupils of its eyes, that people feared to approach, believing it was surrounded in [[black magic]]. It was said the only way to get rid of Old Black Eyes was to draw its picture, pin it to a tree, and then shoot it with a gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Curran|first=Bob|title=Mysterious Celtic Mythology In American Folklore|publisher=Pelican Publishing Company, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=978-1-58980-743-3|location=Gretna, Louisiana|pages=265–266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
[[Santa Claus]], also known as [[Saint Nicholas]], [[Father Christmas]], or simply &quot;Santa&quot;, is a figure with legendary, mythical, historical and folkloric origins. The modern figure of Santa Claus was derived from the Dutch figure, Sinterklaas, which may, in turn, have its origins in the hagiographical tales concerning the Christian Saint Nicholas. &quot;[[A Visit from St. Nicholas]]&quot;, also known as &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot; is a poem first published anonymously in 1823 and generally attributed to Clement Clarke Moore. The poem, which has been called &quot;arguably the best-known verses ever written by an American&quot;,&lt;ref name=gotham&gt;[[Edwin G. Burrows|Burrows, Edwin G.]] &amp; [[Mike Wallace (historian)|Wallace, Mike]]. ''[[Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898]]''.  New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. pp. 462–463 {{ISBN|0-19-511634-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; is largely responsible for the conception of Santa Claus from the mid-nineteenth century to today, including his physical appearance, the night of his visit, his mode of transportation, the number and names of his reindeer, as well as the tradition that he brings toys to children. The poem has influenced ideas about St. Nicholas and Santa Claus from the United States to the rest of the English-speaking world and beyond. ''Is There a Santa Claus?'' was the title of an editorial appearing in the September 21, 1897, edition of The (New York) Sun. The editorial, which included the famous reply &quot;[[Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus]]&quot;, has become a part of popular [[Christmas]] folklore in the United States and Canada.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

The [[Headless Horseman (Legend of Sleepy Hollow)|Headless Horseman]] is a fictional character from the short story &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; by American author Washington Irving. The story, from Irving's collection of short stories, entitled The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, has worked itself into known American folklore/legend through literature and film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hischak|first=Thomas S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EpWpDQAAQBAJ&amp;q=The+Sketch+Book+of+Geoffrey+Crayon%2C+has+worked+itself+into+known+American+folklore%2Flegend+through+literature+and+film&amp;pg=PA259|title=100 Greatest American Plays|date=2017-03-06|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-1-4422-5606-4|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&quot;[[Rip Van Winkle]]&quot;''' is a short story by the American author [[Washington Irving]], first published in 1819. It follows a [[Dutch-American]] villager in [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial America]] named Rip Van Winkle who meets mysterious Dutchmen, imbibes their liquor and falls asleep in the [[Catskill Mountains]]. He awakes 20 years later to a very changed world, having missed the [[American Revolution]].

Inspired by a conversation on [[nostalgia]] with his American expatriate brother-in-law, Irving wrote the story while temporarily living in [[Birmingham]], England. It was published in his collection, ''[[The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.]]'' While the story is set in [[New York (state)|New York]]'s Catskill Mountains near where Irving later took up residence, he admitted, &quot;When I wrote the story, I had never been on the Catskills.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre M. Irving, ''The Life and Letters of Washington Irving'', G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1883, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Pp4EAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA176 vol. 2, p. 176].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folk music==
{{Main|American folk music}}
Native Americans were the earliest inhabitants of the land that is today known as the United States and played its first music. Beginning in the 17th century, immigrants from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Germany and France began arriving in large numbers, bringing with them new styles and instruments. African slaves brought musical traditions, and each subsequent wave of immigrants contributes to a melting pot. Folk music includes both traditional music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th-century folk revival. The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

The earliest American scholars were with The American Folklore Society (AFS), which emerged in the late 1800s. Their studies expanded to include Native American music but still treated folk music as a historical item preserved in isolated societies. In North America, during the 1930s and 1940s, the Library of Congress worked through the offices of traditional music collectors Robert Winslow Gordon, Alan Lomax and others to capture as much North American field material as possible. Lomax was the first prominent scholar to study distinctly American folk music such as that of cowboys and southern blacks. His first major published work was in 1911, Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads, and was arguably the most prominent US folk music scholar of his time, notably during the beginnings of the folk music revival in the 1930s and early 1940s.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

The [[American folk music revival]] was a phenomenon in the United States that began during the 1940s and peaked in popularity in the mid-1960s. Its roots went earlier, and performers like [[Burl Ives]], [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Lead Belly]], and [[Oscar Brand]] had enjoyed a limited general popularity in the 1930s and 1940s. The revival brought forward musical styles that had, in earlier times, contributed to the development of country &amp; western, jazz, and rock and roll music.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===African-American music===
Slavery was introduced to the [[Thirteen Colonies]] beginning in the early 17th century in [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]]. The ancestors of today's African-American population were brought from hundreds of tribes across West Africa and brought with them certain traits of West African music. This included call and response vocals, complex rhythmic music, syncopated beats, shifting accents, incorporation of hums and moans, which are sounds with no distinct meaning, and a combination of sound and body movements. The African musical focus on rhythmic singing and dancing was brought to the New World, where it became part of a distinct folk culture that helped Africans &quot;retain continuity with their past through music.&quot;{{citation needed|date=November 2021}} Along with retaining many African elements, there was also a continuation of instruments. Enslaved Africans would either take with them African instruments or reconstructed them once in the New World. The first slaves in the United States sang work songs and field hollers. However, slave music was used for a variety of reasons. Music was included in religious ceremonies and celebrations, used to coordinate work, and to conceal hidden messages, like when they were commenting on slave owners. African American slave songs can be divided into three groups: religious, work, and recreational songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Bronner|first=Simon J.|date=2017-03-29|title=Folklore in the United States|url=https://oxfordre.com/literature/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.001.0001/acrefore-9780190201098-e-88|access-date=2021-02-23|website=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Literature|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.013.88|isbn=978-0-19-020109-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Roots of African American Music|url=https://music.si.edu/spotlight/african-american-music/roots-of-african-american-music|access-date=2021-02-23|website=Smithsonian Music|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Digital History|url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/era.cfm?eraID=6&amp;smtID=6|access-date=2021-04-07|website=www.digitalhistory.uh.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====African American Spirituals====
Protestant hymns written mostly by New England preachers became a feature of camp meetings held among devout Christians across the South. Most slaves were either animists or Muslims, so they did not know about Christianity. To destroy any remnants of African culture or make more people disciples, slaves would be encouraged and taken to church. They became attracted to the grace and freedom that was preached within the church, which was very different from the lives they were living. Slaves would learn the same hymns that their masters sang, and when they came together they developed and sang adapted versions of these hymns, they were called [[Negro spirituals]]. It was from these roots, of spiritual songs, work songs, and field hollers, that blues, jazz, and gospel developed. Negro spirituals were primarily expressions of religious faith. These songs provided them a voice for their longing for freedom and to experience it. Around the 1840s, slaves knew that in the northern states slavery was illegal, and some northerners wanted the complete abolishment of slavery. So when they sang about heaven, it was also about possibly escaping north. In the early 19th century the Underground railroad was developed, containing a network of secret routes and safe houses, and it greatly impacted slaves’ religious music. When there was any mention of trains, stations, etc. in spirituals they were directly referencing the Underground Railroad, such as the song “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.” These songs were designed so that slave owners thought that slaves were only singing about heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=African American Spirituals |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200197495/ |website=The Library of Congress |access-date=25 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guion&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Guion|first=David|date=2012-06-25|title=Slave music and the Civil War|url=https://music.allpurposeguru.com/2012/06/slave-music-and-the-civil-war/|access-date=2021-04-07|website=Musicology for Everyone|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====African American Work Songs====

Work Songs at least had two functions: one to benefit the slaves and another to benefit overseers. When a group of slaves had to work together on a hard task, like carrying a heavy load, singing would provide a rhythm that allowed them to coordinate their movements. When picking crops, music was not necessary, but when there was silence it would be uncomfortable for the overseers. Even though there was a presence of melancholy in songs, Southern slave owners would interpret that their slaves were happy and content, possibly because of their singing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guion&quot;/&gt;

====African American Recreational Songs====

Even if slave owners attempted to forbid things like drums or remnants of African culture, they did not seem to mind them learning European instruments and music. In some cases, black string players would be invited to play to entertain white audiences. Between the week of Christmas and New Years’, owners would give their slaves a holiday. This provided a chance for slave families who had different masters to come together, otherwise, they would not go anywhere. Some slaves would craft items, but masters detested industrious slaves. So most slaves would spend their recreational time doing other things, like dancing and singing. Masters approved of such activities, but they may not have listened carefully to the songs that were performed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guion&quot;/&gt;

===Folk songs===
The original Thirteen Colonies of the United States were all former British possessions, and Anglo culture became a major foundation for American folk and popular music. Many American folk songs are identical to British songs in arrangements, but with new lyrics, often as parodies of the original material. Anglo-American traditional music also includes a variety of broadside ballads, humorous stories and tall tales, and disaster songs regarding mining, shipwrecks and murder.&lt;ref&gt;Kip Lornell, ''Exploring American Folk Music: Ethnic, Grassroots, and Regional Traditions in the United States'' (Oxford MS: Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2012), 82-117. {{ISBN|1617032662}}; and Duncan Emrich, ed., ''Anglo-American Songs and Ballads'' (Washington DC: Library of Congress, 1947); available online at https://www.loc.gov/folklife/LP/AFS_L12.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;
Folk songs may be classified by subject matter, such as: [[drinking songs]], [[sporting song]]s, train songs, [[work song]]s, [[war songs]], and [[ballad]]s.
* [[The Star-Spangled Banner]]'s tune was adapted from an old English drinking song by John Stafford Smith called &quot;To Anacreon in Heaven.&quot;
* &quot;[[The Ballad of Casey Jones]]&quot; is a traditional song about railroad engineer Casey Jones and his death at the controls of the train he was driving. It tells of how Jones and his fireman Sim Webb raced their locomotive to make up for lost time, but discovered another train ahead of them on the line, and how Jones remained on board to try to stop the train as Webb jumped to safety.
* &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot; (sometimes &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again&quot;) is a popular song of the American Civil War that expressed people's longing for the return of their friends and relatives who were fighting in the war. The Irish anti-war song &quot;Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye&quot; and &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot; share the same melodic material. Based on internal textual references, &quot;Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye&quot; apparently dates from the early 1820s, while When Johnny Comes Marching Home was first published in 1863. &quot;Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye&quot; is a popular traditional Irish anti-war and anti-recruiting song. It is generally dated to the early 19th century, when soldiers from Athy, County Kildare served the British East India Company.
* &quot;Oh My Darling, Clementine&quot; (1884) is an American western folk ballad believed to have been based on another song called Down by the River Liv'd a Maiden (1863). The words are those of a bereaved lover singing about his darling, the daughter of a miner in the 1849 California Gold Rush. He loses her in a drowning accident. The song plays during the opening credits for the highly acclaimed [[John Ford]] movie &quot;[[My Darling Clementine]]&quot;. It also runs as a background score all through the movie.
* [[The Yellow Rose of Texas (song)|The Yellow Rose of Texas]]  is a traditional folk song. The original love song has become associated with the legend that Emily D. West, a biracial indentured servant, &quot;helped win the Battle of San Jacinto, the decisive battle in the Texas Revolution&quot;.
* &quot;[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]&quot; is a 1908 Tin Pan Alley song by Jack Norworth and Albert Von Tilzer which has become the unofficial anthem of baseball, although neither of its authors had attended a game prior to writing the song. The song is traditionally sung during the seventh-inning stretch of a baseball game. Fans are generally encouraged to sing along.

Other American folksongs include: &quot;[[She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain]]&quot;, &quot;[[Skewball]]&quot;, &quot;[[Big Bad John]]&quot;, &quot;[[Stagger Lee (song)|Stagger Lee]]&quot;, &quot;[[Camptown Races]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]&quot;.

===Sea shanties===
{{Main|Sea shanty}}
Work songs sung by sailors between the 18th and 20th centuries are known as sea shanties. The shanty was a distinct type of work song, developed especially in American-style merchant vessels that had come to prominence in decades prior to the American Civil War. These songs were typically performed while adjusting the rigging, raising anchor, and other tasks where men would need to pull in rhythm. These songs usually have a very punctuated rhythm precisely for this reason, along with a call-and-answer format. Well before the 19th century, sea songs were common on rowing vessels. Such songs were also very rhythmic in order to keep the rowers together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Early Naval Ballads of England (1841)|date=2019-06-11|url=https://archive.org/details/earlynavalballa00hallgoog|publisher=Printed for the Percy society by C. Richards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were notably influenced by songs of African Americans, such as those sung whilst manually loading vessels with cotton in ports of the southern United States. The work contexts in which African-Americans sang songs comparable to shanties included: boat-rowing on rivers of the southeastern U.S. and Caribbean; the work of stokers or &quot;firemen&quot;, who cast wood into the furnaces of steamboats plying great American rivers;and stevedoring on the U.S. eastern seaboard, the Gulf Coast, and the Caribbean—including &quot;cotton-screwing&quot;: the loading of ships with cotton in ports of the American South. During the first half of the 19th century, some of the songs African Americans sang also began to appear in use for shipboard tasks, i.e. as shanties.

Shanty repertoire borrowed from the contemporary popular music enjoyed by sailors, including minstrel music, popular marches, and land-based folk songs, which were adapted to suit musical forms matching the various labor tasks required to operate a sailing ship. Such tasks, which usually required a coordinated group effort in either a pulling or pushing action, included weighing anchor and setting sail.
* &quot;Poor Paddy Works on the Railway&quot; is a popular Irish and American folk song. Historically, it was often sung as a sea chanty. The song portrays an Irish worker working on a railroad. There are numerous titles of the song including, &quot;Pat Works on the Railway&quot; and &quot;Paddy on the Railway&quot;. &quot;Paddy Works on the Erie&quot; is another version of the song. &quot;Paddy on the Railway&quot; is attested as a chanty in the earliest known published work to use the word &quot;chanty&quot;, G. E. Clark's ''Seven Years of a Sailor's Life'' (1867). Clark recounted experiences fishing on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, in a vessel out of Provincetown, Mass. c. 1865–66. At one point, the crew is getting up the anchor in a storm, by means of a pump-style windlass. One of the chanties the men sing while performing this task is mentioned by title, &quot;Paddy on the Railway.&quot;

===Shaker music===
{{Shaker music}}
The [[Shakers]] is a religious sect founded in 18th-century England upon the teachings of [[Ann Lee]]. Shakers today are most known for their cultural contributions, especially style of music and furniture. The Shakers composed thousands of songs, and also created many dances; both were an important part of the Shaker worship services. In Shaker society, a [[Era of Manifestations|spiritual &quot;gift&quot;]] could also be a musical revelation, and they considered it important to record musical inspirations as they occurred. &quot;[[Simple Gifts]]&quot; was composed by Elder [[Joseph Brackett]] and originated in the [[Alfred Shaker Historic District|Alfred Shaker community]] in Maine in 1848. [[Aaron Copland]]'s iconic 1944 ballet score [[Appalachian Spring]], uses the now famous Shaker tune &quot;Simple Gifts&quot; as the basis of its finale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Diff|en:Simple_Gifts|diff=|oldid=877536507|label=en:Simple_Gifts,   oldid 877536507}}{{Circular reference|date=August 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folk dancing==
Folk dances of British origin include the square dance, descended from the quadrille, combined with the American innovation of a caller instructing the dancers. The religious [[communal society]] known as the Shakers emigrated from England during the 18th century and developed their own folk dance style.&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Opdahl, V.E.

==Locations and landmarks==
* the &quot;Lost Colony&quot; of Roanoke Island: In 1587, Sir Walter Raleigh recruited over 100 men, women and children to journey from England to Roanoke Island on North Carolina's coast and establish the first English settlement in America under the direction of John White as governor. [[Virginia Dare]] (born August 18, 1587) was the first child born in the Americas to English parents, Ananias and Eleanor White Dare in the short-lived Roanoke Colony. The fact of her birth is known because the governor of the settlement, Virginia Dare's grandfather, John White, returned to England in 1587 to seek fresh supplies. When White eventually returned three years later, Virginia and the other colonists were gone. During the past four hundred years, Virginia Dare has become a prominent figure in American myth and folklore, symbolizing different things to different groups of people. She is the subject of a poem (''Peregrine White and Virginia Dare'') by Rosemary and [[Stephen Vincent Benét]], and the North Carolina ''Legend of the White Doe''. While often cited as an Indian legend, the white doe seems to have its roots in English folklore. White deer are common in English legends and often used as symbols of Christian virtue. A similar story of a young girl transformed into a white deer can be found in Yorkshire, where it formed the basis for Wordsworth's poem ''[[The White Doe of Rylstone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northcarolinaghosts.com/coast/virginia-dare-white-doe.php |title=''Legend of the White Doe'' |publisher=Northcarolinaghosts.com |access-date=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the four centuries since their disappearance, the Roanoke colonists have been the subject of a mystery that still challenges historians and archaeologists as one of America's oldest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coastalguide.com/packet/lostcolony-croatan.shtml |title=Hause, Eric ''The Lost Colony'' |publisher=Coastalguide.com |access-date=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bennington Triangle]] is an area of southwestern Vermont within which a number of people went missing between 1945 and 1950. The area shares characteristics with the [[Bridgewater Triangle]] in [[Southeastern Massachusetts]].
* The [[Bridgewater Triangle]] is an area of about 200 square miles (520 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) within southeastern [[Massachusetts]] in the [[United States]], claimed to be a site of alleged [[paranormal phenomena]], ranging from [[UFO|UFOs]] to [[poltergeists]], orbs, balls of fire and other spectral phenomena, various [[bigfoot]]-like sightings, giant snakes and [[Thunderbird (cryptozoology)|thunderbirds]]. The term was coined by New England based [[Cryptozoology|cryptozoologist]] [[Loren Coleman]].
* [[Times Square]] is a major commercial intersection in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, at the junction of Broadway and Seventh Avenue and stretching from West 42nd to West 47th Streets. Times Square – iconified as &quot;The Crossroads of the World&quot; is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway [[Theater District, Manhattan|Theater District]]. Formerly Longacre Square, Times Square was renamed in April 1904 after The New York Times moved its headquarters to the newly erected Times Building site of the annual ball drop on New Year's Eve. The northern triangle of Times Square is technically Duffy Square, dedicated in 1937 to Chaplain Francis P. Duffy of New York City's &quot;Fighting 69th&quot; Infantry Regiment; a memorial to Duffy is located there, along with a statue of George M. Cohan. The Duffy Statue and the square were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.
[[File:Empirestatebuildingfrombrooklynnewyork.jpg|thumb|upright|The Empire State Building]]
* [[Empire State Building]] is a 102-story skyscraper located in New York City at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and West 34th Street. Its name is derived from the nickname for New York, the Empire State. It stood as the world's tallest building for 40&amp;nbsp;years, from its completion in 1931. The Empire State Building is generally thought of as an American cultural icon. The project involved 3,400 workers, mostly immigrants from Europe, along with hundreds of Mohawk ironworkers, many from the Kahnawake reserve near Montreal. Perhaps the most famous popular culture representation of the building is in the 1933 film King Kong, in which the title character, a giant ape, climbs to the top to escape his captors but falls to his death after being attacked by airplanes. The 1957 romantic drama film An Affair to Remember involves a couple who plan to meet atop the Empire State Building, a rendezvous that is averted by an automobile accident. The 1993 film Sleepless in Seattle, a romantic comedy partially inspired by An Affair to Remember, climaxes with a scene at the Empire State observatory.

Other locations and landmarks that have become part of American folklore include: [[Independence Hall]], [[Monument Valley]], [[Ellis Island]], [[Hoover Dam]], [[Pearl Harbor]], the [[Vietnam War Memorial]], and the [[Grand Canyon]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

==Cultural icons==
* The [[Liberty Bell]] is an iconic symbol of American independence, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The bell was commissioned from the London firm of Lester and Pack in 1752, and was cast with the lettering (part of Leviticus 25:10) &quot;Proclaim LIBERTY throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof.&quot; In the 1830s, the bell was adopted as a symbol by abolitionist societies, who dubbed it the &quot;Liberty Bell&quot;. It acquired its distinctive large crack sometime in the early 19th century—a widespread story claims it cracked while ringing after the death of Chief Justice John Marshall in 1835.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}
* The [[Statue of Liberty]] a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, designed by Frédéric Bartholdi and dedicated on October 28, 1886. The statue, a gift to the United States from the people of France, is of a robed female figure representing Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom, who bears a torch and a tablet upon which is inscribed the date of the American Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776. The statue is an icon of freedom and of the United States: a welcoming signal to immigrants arriving from abroad.
* [[Uncle Sam]] (initials U.S.) is a common national personification of the American government and came into use during the War of 1812. According to legend, Samuel Wilson, a meatpacker in New York, supplied rations for the soldiers and stamped the letters U.S. on the boxes, which stood for United States but was jokingly said to be the initials of Uncle Sam. An Uncle Sam is mentioned as early as 1775, in the original &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; lyrics of the Revolutionary War {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}. &quot;[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]&quot;, who first appeared in 1738 and sometimes was associated with liberty, is the personification of the American nation, while Uncle Sam is a personification of the government; they are some times shown working together or disputing with one another over political issues, especially in the political cartoons of [[Puck (folklore)|Puck]]. With the American Revolutionary War came &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot; as a personification of the [[Americans|American]] [[Everyman]]; but it wasn't until after the War of 1812 Uncle Sam appeared.
* Shark Mouth [[nose art]] on military aircraft: Although originally from Austria this stylistic design was applied to the American Volunteer Group in Asia known more commonly as &quot;The Flying Tigers&quot;. This design was painted on the units' P-40 fighters around the large air intake near the front of the plane. This image has since been placed on various aircraft such as American UH-1 and AH-1 helicopters during the [[Vietnam War]] as well as the modern-day A-10 Thunderbolt II, A-29 Supertucano and AT-6 Wolverine, and other vehicles both military and civilian alike.

Other cultural icons include [[Rosie the Riveter]], the [[United States Constitution]], the [[Colt Single Action Army]], [[Smokey Bear]], the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]], [[Columbia (name)|Columbia]], and [[apple pie]].

The countries of what now make up the Arab world were divided between the two of them—Iraq under Persian rule, Syria, Palestine, and North Africa part of the Byzantine Empire. They spoke a variety of different languages and were for the most part Christians, with some Jewish minorities. Their Arabization and Islamization took place with the vast expansion of Islam in the decades and centuries following the death of the Prophet in 632 CE. The Aramaic language, once dominant in the Fertile Crescent, survives in only a few remote villages and in the rituals of the Eastern churches. Coptic, the language of Christian Egypt before the Arab conquest, has been entirely replaced by Arabic except in the church liturgy. Some earlier languages have survived, notably Kurdish in Southwest Asia and Berber in North Africa, but Arabic, in one form or another, has in effect become the language of everyday speech as well as of government, commerce and culture in what has come to be known as &quot;the Arab world.&quot; |access-date=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basalt, dated in 7 Kislul, 223, viz. 7 December 328 CE. Found at [[Nimreh]] in the [[Hauran]] ([[Southern Syria]]).]]

The earliest documented use of the word ''Arab'' in reference to a people appears in the [[Kurkh Monoliths]], an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian-language]] record of the [[Assyrian conquest of Aram]] (9th century BCE). The Monoliths used the term to refer to [[Bedouin]]s of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] under [[Gindibu|King Gindibu]], who fought as part of a coalition opposed to [[Assyria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Retsop105&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Retsö |first=Jan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pUepRuQO8ZkC&amp;pg=PA105 |title=The Arabs in Antiquity: Their History from the Assyrians to the Umayyads |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7007-1679-1 |author-link=Jan Retsö}} pp. 105, 119, 125–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Listed among the booty captured by the army of the Assyrian king [[Shalmaneser III]] in the [[Battle of Qarqar]] (853 BCE) are 1000 camels of &quot;Gi-in-di-bu'u the ar-ba-a-a&quot; or &quot;[the man] Gindibu belonging to the ''Arabs''&quot; (''ar-ba-a-a'' being an adjectival [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Nisba|nisba]] of the noun ''ʿarab'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Retsop105&quot; /&gt;

The related word ''ʾaʿrāb'' is used to refer to Bedouins today, in contrast to ''ʿarab'' which refers to Arabs in general.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Wehr|Wehr, Hans]], and J. M. Cowan. ''A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic'' (3rd ed.) Ithaca, NY: Spoken Language Services. p. 601.&lt;/ref&gt; Both terms are mentioned around 40 times in pre-Islamic [[Sabaean language|Sabaean]] inscriptions. The term ''ʿarab'' ('Arab') occurs also in the titles of the [[Himyarite Kingdom|Himyarite kings]] from the time of [[Tubba Abu Karab As'ad|'Abu Karab Asad]] until MadiKarib Ya'fur. According to Sabaean grammar, the term ''ʾaʿrāb'' is derived from the term ''ʿarab''. The term is also mentioned in [[Quran]]ic verses, referring to people who were living in [[Medina|Madina]] and it might be a south Arabian [[loanword]] into Quranic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/ABADY_Yemen_Archaeology_9_12 |title=ABADY_Yemen_Archaeology_9_12 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ABADY_Yemen_Archaeology_9_12/page/n142 127], 128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest surviving indication of an Arab national identity is an inscription made in an archaic form of Arabic in 328 CE using the [[Nabataean alphabet]], which refers to [[Imru' al-Qays ibn 'Amr]] as 'King of all the Arabs'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=William Bowden |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFhsk-ccTsAC&amp;pg=PA91 |title=Recent Research on the Late Antique Countryside |last2=Luke Lavan |last3=Carlos Machado |publisher=Brill |year=2004 |isbn=978-90-04-13607-6 |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ira M.

Other Ancient-Greek historians like [[Agatharchides]], [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Strabo]] mention Arabs living in [[Mesopotamia]] (along the [[Euphrates]]), in Egypt (the Sinai and the Red Sea), southern Jordan (the [[Nabataeans]]), the [[Syrian steppe]] and in eastern Arabia (the people of [[Gerrha]]). Inscriptions dating to the 6th century BCE in Yemen include the term 'Arab'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Classics |url=https://oxfordre.com/classics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.001.0001/acrefore-9780199381135-e-644 |date=22 December 2015 |language=en |doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.013.644 |isbn=978-0-19-938113-5 |last2=Healey |first2=J. F. |last1=Salles |first1=Jean-François |chapter=Arabs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular Arab account holds that the word ''Arab'' came from an [[eponym]]ous father named [[Ya'rub]], who was supposedly the first to speak Arabic. [[Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdani]] had another view; he states that Arabs were called ''gharab'' ('westerners') by [[Mesopotamia]]ns because Bedouins originally resided to the west of Mesopotamia; the term was then corrupted into ''arab''.

Yet another view is held by [[al-Masudi]] that the word ''Arab'' was initially applied to the [[Ishmaelites]] of the [[Arabah]] valley. In Biblical etymology, ''Arab'' (Hebrew: ''arvi'') comes from the desert origin of the Bedouins it originally described (''arava'' means 'wilderness').

The root ''ʿ-r-b'' has several additional meanings in Semitic languages—including 'west, sunset', 'desert', 'mingle', 'mixed', 'merchant' and 'raven'—and are &quot;comprehensible&quot; with all of these having varying degrees of relevance to the emergence of the name. It is also possible that some forms were [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathetical]] from {{transliteration|sem|ʿ-B-R}}, 'moving around' (Arabic: {{transliteration|ar|DIN|ʿ-B-R}}, 'traverse') and hence, it is alleged, 'nomadic'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The meaning of Arab land in the historical sources |url=http://uqu.edu.sa/page/ar/56829 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315055238/http://www.uqu.edu.sa/page/ar/56829 |archive-date=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of the Arab States}}
Pre-Islamic Arabia refers to the Arabian Peninsula prior to the rise of Islam in the 630s. The study of Pre-Islamic Arabia is important to&amp;nbsp;[[Islamic studies]] as it provides the context for the development of Islam. Some of the settled communities in the Arabian Peninsula developed into distinctive civilizations. Sources for these civilizations are not extensive, and are limited to archaeological evidence, accounts written outside of Arabia, and Arab oral traditions later recorded by Islamic scholars. Among the most prominent civilizations was [[Dilmun]], which arose around the 4th millennium BCE and lasted to 538 BCE, and [[Thamud]], which arose around the 1st millennium BCE and lasted to about 300 CE. Additionally, from the beginning of the first millennium BCE, [[Southern Arabia]] was the home to a number of kingdoms, such as the [[Sabaean kingdom]] ({{lang-ar|سَـبَـأ|Saba'}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Quote Quran|34|15|e=17|s=ns&quot;&gt;[[Quran 34:15]] {{Quote Quran|34|15-17|b=yl}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly [[Sheba]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheba-01&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Saba / Sa'abia / Sheba |url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsMiddEast/ArabicSaba.htm |access-date=27 June 2008 |publisher=The History Files (http://www.historyfiles.co.uk) |quote=The kingdom of Saba is known to have existed in the region of Yemen. By 1000 BC caravan trains of camels journeyed from Oman in south-east Arabia to the Mediterranean. As the [[camel driver]]s passed through the [[desert]]s of Yemen, experts believe that many of them would have called in at Ma'rib. Dating from at least 1050 BC, and now barren and dry, [[Ma'rib]] was then a lush [[oasis]] teeming with [[palm tree]]s and [[introduced species|exotic]] [[plant]]s. Ideally placed, it was situated on the trade routes and with a unique [[dam]] of vast proportions. It was also one of only two main sources of [[frankincense]] (the other being [[East Africa]]), so Saba had a virtual [[monopoly]]. Ma'rib's [[wealth]] accumulated to such an extent that the city became a byword for riches beyond belief throughout the Arab world. Its people, the [[Sabaeans|Sabeans]] – a group whose name bears the same etymological root as Saba – lived in [[South Arabia]] between the tenth and sixth centuries BC. Their main temple – [[Mahram Bilqis]], or [[temple]] of the moon god (situated about {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} from the capital city of Ma'rib) – was so famous that it remained [[sacred]] even after the collapse of the Sabean civilisation in the sixth century BC – caused by the rerouting of the [[spice]] trail. By that point the dam, now in a poor state of repair, was finally breached. The [[irrigation]] system was lost, the people abandoned the site within a year or so, and the temple fell into disrepair and was eventually covered by sand. Saba was known by the [[Hebrews]] as Sheba ''[Note that the collapse of the dam was actually in 575 [[Common Era|CE]], as shown in the timeline in the same article in the History Files, and attested by MacCulloch (2009)].''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the coastal areas of [[Eastern Arabia]] were controlled by the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanians]] from 300 BCE.

====Origins and early history====
{{further|Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Proto-Arabic}}
According to Arab-[[Islamic–Jewish relations|Islamic-Jewish traditions]], [[Ishmael]] was father of the Arabs, to be the ancestor of the [[Ishmaelites]].
* Both Judaism and Islam see him as the ancestor of Arab peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Jones |first=Lindsay |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0jMOAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Ishmael |title=Encyclopedia of religion |date=2005 |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA |isbn=978-0-02-865740-0 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ishmael is recognized by Muslims as the ancestor of several prominent [[Arab]] [[Tribes of Arabia|tribes]] and being the forefather of Muhammad. ''A–Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', Wheeler, ''Ishmael'' Muslims also believe that Muhammad was the descendant of Ishmael that would establish a great nation, as promised by [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] in the [[Old Testament]].

[[File:Qahtanites.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Traditional [[Qahtanite]] genealogy]]
The first written attestation of the ethnonym ''Arab'' occurs in an [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]] inscription of 853 BCE, where [[Shalmaneser III]] lists a King [[Gindibu]] of ''mâtu arbâi'' (Arab land) as among the people he defeated at the [[Battle of Qarqar]]. Some of the names given in these texts are [[Aramaic]], while others are the first attestations of [[Ancient North Arabian]] dialects. In fact several different ethnonyms are found in Assyrian texts that are conventionally translated &quot;Arab&quot;: ''Arabi, Arubu, Aribi'' and ''Urbi''. Many of the [[Qedarite]] queens were also described as queens of the ''aribi''. The [[Hebrew Bible]] occasionally refers to ''Aravi'' peoples (or variants thereof), translated as &quot;Arab&quot; or &quot;Arabian&quot;.

Medieval Arab [[genealogist]]s divided Arabs into three groups:
# &quot;Ancient Arabs&quot;, tribes that had vanished or been destroyed, such as [[ʿĀd]] and [[Thamud]], often mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] as examples of God's power to vanquish those who fought his prophets.
# &quot;Pure Arabs&quot; of [[South Arabia]], descending from [[Qahtan]]. The [[Qahtanite]]s (Qahtanis) are said to have migrated from the land of [[Yemen]] following the destruction of the [[Ma'rib Dam]] (''sadd Ma'rib'').
# The &quot;Arabized Arabs&quot; (''mustaʿribah'') of Central Arabia ([[Najd]]) and North Arabia, descending from [[Ishmael]] the elder son of [[Abraham]], through [[Adnan]] (hence, [[Adnanites]]). The [[Book of Genesis]] narrates that [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] promised [[Hagar]] to beget from Ishmael twelve princes and turn him to a great nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|17:20|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Jubilees]] claims that the sons of [[Ishmael]] intermingled with the 6 sons of [[Keturah]], from [[Abraham]], and their descendants were called Arabs and [[Ishmaelites]]:

{{blockquote|And Ishmael and his sons, and the sons of [[Keturah]] and their sons, went together and dwelt from [[Desert of Paran|Paran]] to the entering in of [[Babylon]] in all the land towards the East facing the desert. And these mingled with each other, and their name was called Arabs, and [[Ishmaelites]].|Book of Jubilees 20:13}}

[[Ibn Khaldun]]'s ''[[Muqaddima]]'' distinguishes between sedentary Arab Muslims who used to be [[nomad]]ic, and Bedouin nomadic Arabs of the desert. He used the term &quot;formerly nomadic&quot; Arabs and refers to sedentary Muslims by the region or city they lived in, as in [[Demographics of Yemen|Yemenis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Levity&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Levity.com, Islam |url=http://www.levity.com/alchemy/islam20.html |access-date=13 April 2010 |publisher=Levity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christians of Italy and the Crusaders preferred the term [[Saracens]] for all the Arabs, Muslims.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lionheart&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Eyewitnesstohistory |url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/lionheart.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402073536/http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/lionheart.htm |archive-date=2 April 2010 |access-date=13 April 2010 |website=Eyewitnesstohistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christians of [[Iberia]] used the term [[Moors|Moor]] to describe all the Arabs and Muslims of that time.

Muslims of [[Medina]] referred to the [[nomad]]ic tribes of the deserts as the A'raab, and considered themselves sedentary, but were aware of their close racial bonds. The term &quot;A'raab&quot; mirrors the term Assyrians used to describe the closely related nomads they defeated in Syria. The [[Qur'an]] does not use the word {{transliteration|ar|ʿarab}}, only the [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Nisba|nisba]] adjective {{transliteration|ar|ʿarabiy}}. The Qur'an calls itself {{transliteration|ar|ʿarabiy}}, &quot;Arabic&quot;, and {{transliteration|ar|Mubin}}, &quot;clear&quot;. The two qualities are connected for example in [[Quran 43:2-3]], &quot;By the ''clear'' Book: We have made it an ''Arabic'' recitation in order that you may understand&quot;. The Qur'an became regarded as the prime example of the {{transliteration|ar|al-ʿarabiyya}}, the language of the Arabs. The term ''[[ʾiʿrāb]]'' has the same root and refers to a particularly clear and correct mode of speech. The plural noun {{transliteration|ar|ʾaʿrāb}} refers to the [[Bedouin]] tribes of the desert who resisted Muhammad, for example in ''[[at-Tawba]]'' 97,

{{transliteration|ar|al-ʾaʿrābu ʾašaddu kufrān wanifāqān}} &quot;the Bedouin are the worst in [[kufr|disbelief]] and hypocrisy&quot;.

Based on this, in early Islamic terminology, {{transliteration|ar|ʿarabiy}} referred to the language, and {{transliteration|ar|ʾaʿrāb}} to the Arab Bedouins, carrying a negative connotation due to the Qur'anic verdict just cited. But after the [[Islamic conquest]] of the eighth century, the language of the nomadic Arabs became regarded as the most pure by the grammarians following [[Abi Ishaq]], and the term {{transliteration|ar|kalam al-ʿArab}}, &quot;language of the Arabs&quot;, denoted the uncontaminated language of the Bedouins.

[[File:Al-Khazneh (The Treasury) 2, Petra, Jordan.jpg|thumb|Façade of [[Al Khazneh]] in [[Petra]], Jordan, built by the [[Nabateans]].]]
Proto-Arabic, or [[Ancient North Arabian]], texts give a clearer picture of the Arabs' emergence. The earliest are written in variants of [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraphic]] south Arabian ''[[South Arabian alphabet|musnad]]'' script, including the 8th century BCE [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Hasaean]] inscriptions of eastern Saudi Arabia, the 6th century BCE [[Lihyanite]] texts of southeastern Saudi Arabia and the [[Thamudic]] texts found throughout the Arabian Peninsula and [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] (not in reality connected with [[Thamud]]).

The [[Nabataeans]] were nomadic Arabs who moved into territory vacated by the [[Edomites]]&amp;nbsp;– Semites who settled the region centuries before them. Their early inscriptions were in [[Aramaic]], but gradually switched to Arabic, and since they had writing, it was they who made the first inscriptions in Arabic. The [[Nabataean alphabet]] was adopted by Arabs to the south, and evolved into modern Arabic script around the 4th century. This is attested by [[Safaitic]] inscriptions (beginning in the 1st century BCE) and the many Arabic personal names in [[Nabataean]] inscriptions. From about the 2nd century BCE, a few inscriptions from [[Qaryat al-Faw]] reveal a dialect no longer considered ''proto-Arabic'', but ''pre-classical Arabic''. Five [[Syriac language|Syriac]] inscriptions mentioning Arabs have been found at [[Sumatar Harabesi]], one of which dates to the 2nd century CE.

The [[Ghassanids]], [[Lakhmids]] and [[Kindites]] were the last major migration of pre-Islamic Arabs out of Yemen to the north. The Ghassanids increased the Semitic presence in the then Hellenized [[Syria (Byzantine province)|Syria]], the majority of Semites were Aramaic peoples. They mainly settled in the [[Hauran]] region and spread to modern [[Lebanon]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Jordan]].

[[File:Roman Empire 125 political map.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|The [[imperial province]] of [[Arabia Petraea]] in 117–138 CE]]

The [[Emesene dynasty|Emesene]] were a Roman client dynasty of Arab priest-kings known to have ruled from [[Emesa]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]]. Roman empress [[Julia Domna]], matriarch of the [[Severan dynasty]] of [[Roman emperor]]s, was one of their descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Bowman |first1=Alan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MNSyT_PuYVMC |title=The Cambridge Ancient History: Volume 12, The Crisis of Empire, AD 193–337 |last2=Garnsey |first2=Peter |last3=Cameron |first3=Averil |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-521-30199-2 |page=502 |author-link=Alan Bowman |author-link2=Peter Garnsey |author-link3=Averil Cameron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lakhmids]] as a dynasty inherited their power from the [[Tanukh]]ids, the mid Tigris region around their capital [[Al-Hira]]. They ended up allying with the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanids]] against the Ghassanids and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Lakhmids contested control of the Central Arabian tribes with the Kindites with the Lakhmids eventually destroying the [[Kingdom of Kinda]] in 540 after the fall of their main ally [[Himyar]]. The [[Persian people|Persian]] Sassanids dissolved the Lakhmid dynasty in 602, being under puppet kings, then under their direct control.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bailey [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ko_RafMSGLkC&amp;pg=PR59 The Cambridge history of Iran: The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian periods], Volume 1, Cambridge University Press, 1983, {{ISBN|0-521-20092-X}} p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
The Kindites migrated from Yemen along with the Ghassanids and Lakhmids, but were turned back in Bahrain by the Abdul Qais [[Rabi`ah|Rabi'a]] tribe. They returned to Yemen and allied themselves with the Himyarites who installed them as a vassal kingdom that ruled Central Arabia from &quot;Qaryah Dhat Kahl&quot; (the present-day called Qaryat al-Faw). They ruled much of the Northern/Central Arabian peninsula, until they were destroyed by the Lakhmid king [[Al-Mundhir III ibn al-Nu'man|Al-Mundhir]], and his son [['Amr III ibn al-Mundhir|'Amr]].

After the death of [[Muhammad]] in 632, [[Rashidun army|Rashidun armies]] launched campaigns of conquest, establishing the [[Caliphate]], or Islamic Empire, one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires in history]]. It was larger and lasted longer than the previous Arab empire of [[Mavia (queen)|Queen Mawia]] or the [[Arameans|Aramean]]-Arab [[Palmyrene Empire]]. The Rashidun state was a completely new state and unlike the Arab kingdoms of its century such as the [[Himyarite]], [[Lakhmids]] or [[Ghassanids]].

In 661, the Rashidun Caliphate fell into the hands of the [[Banu Umayya|Umayyad dynasty]] and [[Damascus]] was established as the empire's capital. The Umayyads were proud of their Arab identity and sponsored the poetry and culture of pre-Islamic Arabia. They established garrison towns at [[Ramla]], [[Raqqa]], [[Basra]], [[Kufa]], [[Mosul]] and [[Samarra]], all of which developed into major cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lunde&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lunde |first=Paul |title=Islam |publisher=Dorling Kindersley Publishing |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7894-8797-1 |location=New York |pages=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] established Arabic as the Caliphate's official language in 686.&lt;ref&gt;John Joseph Saunders, ''A history of medieval Islam'', Routledge, 1965, page 13&lt;/ref&gt; This reform greatly influenced the conquered non-Arab peoples and fueled the [[Arabization]] of the region. However, the Arabs' higher status among non-Arab Muslim converts and the latter's obligation to pay heavy taxes caused resentment. Caliph [[Umar II]] strove to resolve the conflict when he came to power in 717. He rectified the disparity, demanding that all Muslims be treated as equals, but his intended reforms did not take effect, as he died after only three years of rule. By now, discontent with the Umayyads swept the region and an uprising occurred in which the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] came to power and moved the capital to [[Baghdad]].

[[File:Dome of the Rock III, Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|The [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]], constructed during the reign of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al Malik]]]]
Umayyads expanded their Empire westwards capturing North Africa from the Byzantines. Before the Arab conquest, North Africa was conquered or settled by various people including [[Punics]], Vandals and Romans. After the [[Abbasid Revolution]], the Umayyads lost most of their territories with the exception of Iberia. Their last holding became known as the [[Emirate of Córdoba]]. It wasn't until the rule of the grandson of the founder of this new emirate that the state entered a new phase as the [[Caliphate of Córdoba]]. This new state was characterized by an expansion of trade, culture and knowledge, and saw the construction of masterpieces of [[al-Andalus]] architecture and the library of [[Al-Ḥakam II]] which housed over 400,000 volumes. With the collapse of the Umayyad state in 1031 CE, [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] was divided into [[Taifa|small kingdoms]].

The Abbasids were&amp;nbsp;the descendants of&amp;nbsp;[[Al-Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib|Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib]], one of the youngest uncles of Muhammad and of the same&amp;nbsp;[[Banu Hashim]]&amp;nbsp;clan. The Abbasids led a revolt against the Umayyads and defeated them in the [[Battle of the Zab]] effectively ending their rule in all parts of the Empire with the exception of [[al-Andalus]]. In 762, the second Abbasid Caliph [[al-Mansur]] founded the city of [[Baghdad]] and declared it the capital of the Caliphate. Unlike the Umayyads, the Abbasids had the support of non-Arab subjects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lunde&quot; /&gt;

The [[Islamic Golden Age]] was inaugurated by the middle of the 8th century by the ascension of the Abbasid Caliphate and the transfer of the capital from [[Damascus]] to the newly founded city of [[Baghdad]]. The Abbasids were influenced by the [[Qur'an]]ic injunctions and [[hadith]] such as &quot;The ink of the scholar is more holy than the blood of martyrs&quot; stressing the value of knowledge. During this period the [[Muslim world]] became an intellectual centre for science, philosophy, medicine and education as the Abbasids championed the cause of knowledge and established the &quot;[[House of Wisdom]]&quot; ({{Lang-ar|بيت الحكمة}}) in Baghdad. Rival dynasties such as the [[Fatimid]]s of [[Egypt]] and the [[Umayyad]]s of [[al-Andalus]] were also major intellectual centres with cities such as [[Cairo]] and [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] rivaling [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vartan&quot;&gt;Vartan Gregorian, &quot;Islam: A Mosaic, Not a Monolith&quot;, Brookings Institution Press, 2003, pg 26–38 {{ISBN|0-8157-3283-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harun-Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|[[Harun al-Rashid]] receiving a delegation sent by [[Charlemagne]]]]
The Abbasids ruled for 200 years before they lost their central control when [[Wilayah|Wilayas]] began to fracture in the 10th century; afterwards, in the 1190s, there was a revival of their power, which was ended by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], who [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|conquered Baghdad]] in 1258 and killed the Caliph [[Al-Musta'sim]]. Members of the Abbasid royal family escaped the massacre and resorted to Cairo, which had broken from the Abbasid rule two years earlier; the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] generals taking the political side of the kingdom while Abbasid Caliphs were engaged in civil activities and continued patronizing science, arts and literature.

The Fatimid caliphate was founded by [[Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah|al-Mahdi Billah]], a descendant of [[Fatimah]], the daughter of Muhammad, in the early 10th century. Egypt was the political, cultural, and religious centre of the Fatimid empire. The Fatimid state took shape among the [[Kutama]] Berbers, in the West of the North African littoral, in Algeria, in 909 conquering [[Raqqada]], the [[Aghlabid]] capital. In 921 the Fatimids established the Tunisian city of [[Mahdia]] as their new capital. In 948 they shifted their capital to [[Mansouria, Tunisia|Al-Mansuriya]], near [[Kairouan]] in Tunisia, and in 969 they conquered Egypt and established [[Cairo]] as the capital of their caliphate.

Intellectual life in Egypt during the Fatimid period achieved great progress and activity, due to many scholars who lived in or came to Egypt, as well as the number of books available. Fatimid Caliphs gave prominent positions to scholars in their courts, encouraged students, and established libraries in their palaces, so that scholars might expand their knowledge and reap benefits from the work of their predecessors.&lt;ref name=&quot;imamreza.net&quot;&gt;Shorter Shi'ite Encyclopaedia, By: Hasan al-Amin, {{Cite web |title=Fatimid Dynasty in Egypt |url=http://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?id=574 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616060639/http://imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?id=574 |archive-date=16 June 2010 |access-date=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fatimids were also known for their exquisite arts. Many traces of [[Fatimid architecture]] exist in Cairo today; the most defining examples include [[Al-Hakim Mosque]] and the [[Al-Azhar University]].

It was not until the 11th century that the [[Maghreb]] saw a large influx of ethnic Arabs. Starting with the 11th century, the Arab bedouin [[Banu Hilal]] tribes migrated to the West. Having been sent by the [[Fatimids]] to punish the Berber [[Zirids]] for abandoning [[Shia Islam|Shias]], they travelled westwards. The Banu Hilal quickly defeated the Zirids and deeply weakened the neighboring [[Hammadid]]s. According to some modern historians. their influx was a major factor in the arabization of the Maghreb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Shillington |first=Kevin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=umyHqvAErOAC&amp;q=arabization+tribes+maghreb+banu+hilal&amp;pg=PA668 |title=Encyclopedia of African History 3-Volume Set |date=4 July 2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-45670-2 |pages=668 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Joris |first1=Pierre |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MVQlDQAAQBAJ&amp;q=arabization+tribes+maghreb+banu+hilal&amp;pg=PA42 |title=Poems for the Millennium, Volume Four: The University of California Book of North African Literature |last2=Tengour |first2=Habib |date=2012 |publisher=Univ of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-26913-2 |pages=42 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Berbers ruled the region until the 16th century (under such powerful dynasties as the [[Almoravids]], the [[Almohads]], [[Hafsids]], etc.), the arrival of these tribes eventually helped Arabize much of it ethnically, in addition to the linguistic and political impact on local non-Arabs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

From 1517 to 1918, much of the Arab world was under the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans defeated the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] in Cairo, and ended the Abbasid Caliphate. Arabs did not feel the change of administration because the Ottomans modeled their rule after the previous Arab administration systems.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 1911, Arab intellectuals and politicians from throughout the Levant formed [[al-Fatat]] (&quot;the Young Arab Society&quot;), a small Arab nationalist club, in Paris. Its stated aim was &quot;raising the level of the Arab nation to the level of modern nations.&quot; In the first few years of its existence, al-Fatat called for greater autonomy within a unified Ottoman state rather than Arab independence from the empire. Al-Fatat hosted the [[Arab Congress of 1913]] in Paris, the purpose of which was to discuss desired reforms with other dissenting individuals from the Arab world. However, as the Ottoman authorities cracked down on the organization's activities and members, al-Fatat went underground and demanded the complete independence and unity of the Arab provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Choueiri166&quot;&gt;Choueiri, pp.166–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], when the [[Ottoman Empire]] was overthrown by the [[British Empire]], former Ottoman colonies were divided up between the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[France|French]] as [[League of Nations mandate]]s.

Today, the main unifying characteristic among Arabs is [[Arabic]], a [[Central Semitic languages|Central Semitic language]] from the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic language family]]. [[Modern Standard Arabic]] serves as the [[Standard language|standardized]] and [[literary language|literary]] variety of Arabic used in writing. The Arabs are first mentioned in the mid-ninth century BCE as a tribal people dwelling in the central Arabian Peninsula subjugated by [[Upper Mesopotamia]]-based state of Assyria. The Arabs appear to have remained largely under the vassalage of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–605 BCE), and then the succeeding [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (605–539 BCE), Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] (539–332 BCE), [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]]/[[Seleucid Empire]] and [[Parthian Empire]].

Arab tribes, most notably the [[Ghassanids]] and [[Lakhmids]] begin to appear in the south Syrian deserts and southern Jordan from the mid 3rd century CE onwards, during the mid to later stages of the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Sasanian Empire]]. Also, before them the [[Nabataeans]] of Jordan and arguably the [[Royal family of Emesa|Emessans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Bowman |first1=Alan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MNSyT_PuYVMC&amp;q=Emesa+dynasty+arab&amp;pg=PA502 |title=The Cambridge Ancient History: Volume 12, The Crisis of Empire, AD 193–337 |last2=Garnsey |first2=Peter |last3=Cameron |first3=Averil |date=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-30199-2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Osroene|Edessans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Bowman |first1=Alan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MNSyT_PuYVMC&amp;q=Abgar+arab&amp;pg=PA508 |title=The Cambridge Ancient History: Volume 12, The Crisis of Empire, AD 193–337 |last2=Garnsey |first2=Peter |last3=Cameron |first3=Averil |date=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-30199-2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hatra]]ns&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Bowman |first1=Alan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MNSyT_PuYVMC&amp;q=Hatran+arabs&amp;pg=PA500 |title=The Cambridge Ancient History: Volume 12, The Crisis of Empire, AD 193–337 |last2=Garnsey |first2=Peter |last3=Cameron |first3=Averil |date=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-30199-2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; all appear to have been an Aramaic speaking ethnic Arabs who came to rule much of the pre-Islamic [[fertile crescent]] often as vassals of the two rival empires, the Sasanian (Persian) and the Byzantine (Eastern Roman).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Sluglett |first1=Peter |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XjxyBgAAQBAJ&amp;q=arabs+ruled+the+fertile+crescent+as+vassals+of+persians+and+romans&amp;pg=PA13 |title=Atlas of Islamic History |last2=Currie |first2=Andrew |date=30 January 2015 |isbn=978-1-317-58897-9 |quote=The Fertile Crescent, on the edges of northern Arabia, formed part of the frontier between the two rival empires of the day, the Sasanian (Persian) and the Byzantine (Eastern Roman).

[[File:Pre Islamic Arabia.PNG|thumb|[[Tribes of Arabia|Arab tribes]] before the spread of Islam]]
{{Further|Tribes of Arabia}}
Arabs in the narrow sense are the indigenous Arabians who trace their roots back to the [[tribes of Arabia]] and their immediate descendant groups in the Levant and North Africa. Within the people of the Arabian Peninsula, distinction is made between:
* &quot;Perishing Arabs&quot; ({{lang-ar|الـعـرب الـبـائـدة}}), which are ancient tribes about whose history little is known. They include [[ʿĀd]] ({{lang-ar|عَـاد}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;Quote Quran|54|21-26|b=yl&quot;&gt;[[Q54:21]] {{Quote Quran|54|21-26|b=yl}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thamud|Thamûd]] ({{lang-ar|ثَـمُـود}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;Quote Quran|7|73-157|b=yl&quot;&gt;[[Q7:73-157]] {{Quote Quran|7|73-157|b=yl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tasm, Jadis, Imlaq and others. Jadis and Tasm perished because of genocide. 'Aad and Thamud perished because of their decadence, as recorded in the Qur'an. Archaeologists have recently uncovered inscriptions that contain references to ''Iram dhāṫ al-'Imād'' ({{lang-ar|إِرَم ذَات الـعِـمَـاد}}, [[Iram of the Pillars]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Quote Quran|54|21-26|b=yl&quot; /&gt; which was a major city of the 'Aad. Imlaq is the singular form of 'Amaleeq and is probably synonymous to the biblical [[Amalek]].
* &quot;Pure Arabs&quot; ({{lang-ar|الـعـرب الـعـاربـة}}) or [[Qahtanites]] from [[Yemen]], taken to be descended from [[Ya'rub|Ya'rub ibn Yashjub ibn Qahtan]] and further from [[Hud (prophet)|Hud]].
* &quot;Arabized Arabs&quot; ({{lang-ar|الـعـرب الـمـسـتـعـربـة}}) or [[Adnanites]], taken to be the descendants of [[Ishmael]] son of Abraham.

Arabians are most prevalent in the Arabian Peninsula, but are also found in large numbers in Mesopotamia ([[Arab tribes in Iraq]]), the Levant and Sinai ([[Negev Bedouin]], [[Tarabin bedouin]]), as well as the Maghreb (Eastern Libya, South Tunisia and South Algeria) and the Sudan region.
This traditional division of the Arabs of Arabia may have arisen at the time of the [[First Fitna]]. Of the [[Arabian tribes that interacted with Muhammad]], the most prominent was the [[Quraysh]]. The Quraysh subclan, the [[Banu Hashim]], was the clan of Muhammad. During the early Muslim conquests and the [[Islamic Golden Age]], the political rulers of Islam were exclusively members of the Quraysh.

The Arab presence in Iran did not begin with the [[Arab conquest of Persia]] in 633 CE. For centuries, Iranian rulers had maintained contacts with Arabs outside their borders, dealt with Arab subjects and client states (such as those of Iraq and Yemen), and settled Arab tribesmen in various parts of the Iranian plateau. It follows that the &quot;Arab&quot; conquests and settlements were by no means the exclusive work of Arabs from the [[Hejaz]] and the tribesmen of inner Arabia. The Arab infiltration into Iran began before the Muslim conquests and continued as a result of the joint exertions of the civilized Arabs (ahl al-madar) as well as the desert Arabs (ahl al-wabar).&lt;ref name=&quot;IranicaDaniel&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Arab settlements in Iran |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/arab-iii |access-date=9 April 2011 |last=Daniel |first=E.

Smaller groups are the [[Khamseh]] nomads in [[Fars Province]] and the [[Arabs in Khorasan]].

The Arabs of the [[Levant]] are traditionally divided into [[Qays and Yaman tribes]]. This tribal division is likewise taken to date to the Umayyad period. The Yemen trace their origin to South Arabia or [[Yemen]]; they include [[Banu Kalb]], [[Kinda (tribe)|Kinda]], [[Ghassanids]], and [[Lakhmids]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Kennedy ''The Armies of the Caliphs: Military and Society in the Early Islamic State'' p.33 Routledge, 17 June 2013 {{ISBN|1-134-53113-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1834 [[Peasants' revolt in Palestine]], the Arabic-speaking population of Palestine has shed its formerly tribal structure and emerged as the [[Palestinians]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}.

The Bedouins of western Egypt and eastern Libya are traditionally divided into [[Saʿada and Murabtin]], the Saʿada having higher social status. This may derive from a historical feudal system in which the Murabtin were vassals to the Saʿada.

In [[Sudan]], there are numerous Arabic-speaking tribes, including the [[Shaigya]], [[Ja'alin]] and [[Shukria tribe|Shukria]], who are ancestrally related to the [[Nubian people|Nubians]]. These groups are collectively known as [[Sudanese Arabs]]. In addition, there are other Afroasiatic-speaking populations, such as [[Copts]] and [[Beja people|Beja]].
[[File:Chief of Mascara.jpg|thumb|Commander and Amir of [[Mascara, Algeria|Mascara]], [[Banu Hilal]]]]
The medieval [[trans-Saharan slave trade]] in the Sudan drove a wedge between the [[Arabization|Arabized]] Sudanese and the non-Arabized [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] Sudanese populations. It has contributed to ethnic conflict in the region, such as the [[Sudanese conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile]], [[Northern Mali conflict]], or the [[Boko Haram insurgency]].

The Arabs of the Maghreb are descendants of Arabian tribes of [[Banu Hilal]], the [[Banu Sulaym]] and the [[Maqil]] native of [[Middle East]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Clio |title=François Decret, Les invasions hilaliennes en Ifrîqiya – Clio – Voyage Culturel |url=https://www.clio.fr/BIBLIOTHEQUE/les_invasions_hilaliennes_en_ifriqiya.asp |access-date=28 September 2015 |website=www.clio.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of other tribes native to [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Yemen]] and [[Iraq]]. Arabs and [[Arabic]]-speakers inhabit plains and cities. The [[Banu Hilal]] spent almost a century in [[Egypt]] before moving to [[Libya]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]], and another century later some moved to [[Morocco]], it is logical to think that they are mixed with inhabitants of [[Egypt]] and with [[Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique septentrionale par Ibn Khaldoun&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arab diaspora]] refers to descendants of the [[Arab people|Arab]] [[Emigration|immigrants]] who, voluntarily or as refugees, emigrated from their native lands in non-Arab countries, primarily in [[East Africa]], [[South America]], [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Australia]] and parts of [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Caribbean]], and [[West Africa]]. According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], there are 13 million first-generation Arab migrants in the world, of which 5.8 million reside in Arab countries. Arab expatriates contribute to the circulation of financial and human capital in the region and thus significantly promote regional development. In 2009, Arab countries received a total of 35.1 billion USD in [[remittance]] in-flows and remittances sent to [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]] and [[Lebanon]] from other Arab countries are 40 to 190 per cent higher than trade revenues between these and other Arab countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egypt.iom.int/Doc/IOM%20Intra%20regional%20labour%20mobility%20in%20Arab%20region%20Facts%20and%20Figures%20(English).pdf Intra-Regional Labour Mobility in the Arab World] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507114953/http://www.egypt.iom.int/Doc/IOM%20Intra%20regional%20labour%20mobility%20in%20Arab%20region%20Facts%20and%20Figures%20(English).pdf |date=7 May 2016 }}, International Organization for Migration (IOM) Cairo&lt;/ref&gt; The 250,000 strong Lebanese community in [[West Africa]] is the largest non-African group in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=20 May 2011 |title=Lebanese in west Africa: Far from home |newspaper=The Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2011/05/lebanese_west_africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=10 January 2010 |title=Tenacity and risk – the Lebanese in West Africa |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8479134.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab traders have long operated in [[Southeast Asia]] and along the [[East Africa]]'s [[Swahili coast]].

'''Arab culture''' is the culture of the Arabs, from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the west to the [[Arabian Sea]] in the east, and from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the north to the Horn of Africa and the Indian Ocean in the southeast. The various religions the Arabs have adopted throughout [[History of the Arabs|their history]] and the various empires and kingdoms that have ruled and took lead of the Arabian civilization have contributed to the [[ethnogenesis]] and formation of modern Arab culture. [[Language]], [[literature]], [[gastronomy]], [[art]], [[architecture]], [[music]], [[spirituality]], [[philosophy]] and [[mysticism]] are all part of the cultural heritage of the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Doris |first=Behrens-Abouseif |title=Beauty in Arabic culture |date=1999-01-01 |publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers |isbn=978-1558761995 |oclc=40043536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabs share [[basic belief]]s and [[values]] that cross national and [[social class]] boundaries. Social attitudes have remained constant because Arab society is more conservative and demands conformity from its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=ARAB CUSTOMS AND CULTURE |url=http://www.higginsctc.org/terrorism/ARABCUSTOMSANDCUL.rtf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818232305/http://higginsctc.org/terrorism/ARABCUSTOMSANDCUL.rtf |archive-date=18 August 2016 |access-date=19 May 2017 |website=webcache.googleusercontent.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Learning Arabic calligraphy.jpg|thumb|left|[[Arabic calligraphy]]]]
Another important and unifying characteristic of Arabs is a common [[language]].

Arabic has developed into at least two distinct forms. [[Classical Arabic]] is the form of the [[Arabic language]] used in literary texts from [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] times (7th to 9th centuries). It is based on the medieval dialects of [[Tribes of Arabia|Arab tribes]]. [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (MSA) is the direct descendant used today throughout the [[Arab world]] in writing and in formal speaking, for example, prepared speeches, some radio broadcasts, and non-entertainment content,{{sfn|Bin-Muqbil|2006|p=14}} while the [[Lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] and [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]] of [[Modern Standard Arabic]] are different from [[Classical Arabic]]. Colloquial Arabic, an informal spoken language, varies by dialect from region to region; various forms of the language are in use today and provide an important force for Arab cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Arabs facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Arabs |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/anthropology-and-archaeology/people/arabs |access-date=18 December 2017 |website=Encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They possess free will (that is, they can choose to be good or evil) and come in two flavors. There are the Marids, usually described as the most powerful type of Jinn. These are the type of genie with the ability to grant wishes to humans. However, granting these wishes is not free. The Quran says that the ''jinn'' were created from &quot;mārijin min nar&quot; (''smokeless fire'' or ''a mixture of fire''; scholars explained, this is the part of the flame, which mixed with ''the blackness of fire'').&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin W.

[[File:Folio Blue Quran Met 2004.88.jpg|thumb|right|The Qur'an is one of the most influential examples of Arabic literature]]

The [[Qur'an]], the main [[Religious text|holy book]] of [[Islam]], had a significant influence on the Arabic language, and marked the beginning of [[Islamic literature]]. Muslims believe it was transcribed in the Arabic dialect of the [[Quraysh]], the tribe of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2019-09-08 |title=الوثائقية تفتح ملف &quot;اللغة العربية&quot; |url=https://doc.aljazeera.net/followup/الوثائقية-تفتح-ملف-اللغة-العربية/ |access-date=2020-06-18 |website=الجزيرة الوثائقية |language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Islam spread, the Quran had the effect of unifying and standardizing Arabic.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Not only is the Qur'an the first work of any significant length written in the language, but it also has a far more complicated structure than the earlier literary works with its 114 ''[[surah|suwar]]'' (chapters) which contain 6,236 ''[[ayat]]'' (verses). It contains [[injunction]]s, [[narrative]]s, [[homilies]], [[parable]]s, direct addresses from God, instructions and even comments on how the Qu'ran will be received and understood. It is also admired for its layers of metaphor as well as its clarity, a feature which is mentioned in [[An-Nahl]], the 16th surah.

[[Al-Jahiz]] (born 776, in [[Basra]] – December 868/January 869) was an Arab prose writer and author of works of literature, [[Mu'tazili]] theology, and politico-religious polemics. A leading scholar in the Abbasid Caliphate, his canon includes two hundred books on various subjects, including [[Arabic grammar]], [[zoology]], poetry, lexicography, and [[rhetoric]]. Of his writings, only thirty books survive. Al-Jāḥiẓ was also one of the first Arabian writers to suggest a complete overhaul of the language's grammatical system, though this would not be undertaken until his fellow linguist [[Ibn Maḍāʾ]] took up the matter two hundred years later.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shawqi Daif]], Introduction to Ibn Mada's ''Refutation of the Grammarians'', pg. 48. Cairo, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a small remnant of [[pre-Islamic poetry]], but Arabic literature predominantly emerges in the [[Middle Ages]], during the [[Golden Age of Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Arabic literature |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Arabic-literature |website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] is derived from [[Classical Arabic]], based on the language of the [[Quran]] as it was analyzed by [[Arabic grammarians]] beginning in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Literature |url=https://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/arablit.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102163724/https://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/arablit.htm |archive-date=2 January 2017 |website=Library.cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic literature and [[Arab culture|culture]] declined significantly after the 13th century, to the benefit of [[Ottoman Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Persian literature|Persian]]. A modern revival took place beginning in the 19th century, alongside [[national awakenings under the Ottoman Empire|resistance against Ottoman rule]]. The literary revival is known as ''[[al-Nahda]]'' in Arabic, and was centered in [[Egypt]] and [[Lebanon]]. Two distinct trends can be found in the ''nahda'' period of revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Arabic Literature |url=http://www.indigenouspeople.net/arabiclit/ |access-date=18 December 2017 |website=Indigenouspeople.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first was a neo-classical movement which sought to rediscover the literary traditions of the past, and was influenced by traditional literary genres—such as the ''[[maqama]]''—and works like ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.

The three main regions, also known as the [[Maghreb]], the [[Mashriq]], and the [[Eastern Arabia|Khaleej]] have many similarities, but also many unique traditions. These kitchens have been influenced by the climate, cultivating possibilities, as well as trading possibilities. The kitchens of the Maghreb and [[Levant]] are relatively young kitchens which were developed over the past centuries. The kitchen from the Khaleej region is a very old kitchen. The kitchens can be divided into the [[Urban area|urban]] and [[Rural area|rural]] kitchens.

[[Arab cuisine]] mostly follows one of three culinary traditions – from the Maghreb, the Levant or [[Eastern Arabian cuisine|Eastern Arabia]]. In the Maghreb countries ([[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]]) traditional main meals are [[tajine]]s or dishes using [[couscous]]. In the [[Levant]] ([[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]) main meals usually start with [[Meze|mezze]] – small dishes of dips and other items which are eaten with bread. This is typically followed by skewers of grilled lamb or chicken. Gulf cuisine, tends to be more highly spiced with more use of rice. Sometimes a lamb is roasted and served whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Food and recipes&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Food and recipes |url=http://al-bab.com/special-topics/food-and-recipes |website=al-bab.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arabic art]] takes on many forms, though it is [[jewelry]], [[textile]]s and [[architecture]] that are the most well-known. It is generally split up by different eras, among them being [[History of the Arabic alphabet|early Arabic]], [[early medieval]], [[late medieval]], [[Arabic|late Arabic]], and finally, current Arabic. One thing to remember is that many times a particular style from one era may continue into the next with few changes, while some have a drastic transformation.

Arabic writing is done from right to left, and was generally written in dark inks, with certain things embellished with special colored inks (red, green, gold). In early Arabic and [[Early Middle Ages|early Medieval]], writing was typically done on parchment made of animal skin. The ink showed up very well on it, and occasionally the parchment was dyed a separate color and brighter ink was used (this was only for special projects). The name given to the form of writing in early times was called [[Kufic]] script.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=25 April 2011 |title=A Brief History on Arabic Art: Different Forms of Arabic Artworks Outlined |url=http://www.brighthubeducation.com/history-homework-help/115127-arabic-art-and-architecture-brief-history/ |website=Bright Hub Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arabic miniatures''' ([[Arabic]]: الْمُنَمْنَمَات الْعَرَبِيَّة, ''Al-Munamnamāt al-ʿArabīyah'') are small [[painting]]s on [[paper]], usually book or manuscript illustrations but also sometimes separate artworks that occupy entire pages. The earliest example dates from around 690 AD, with a flourishing of the art from between 1000 and 1200 AD in the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid caliphate]]. The art form went through several stages of evolution while witnessing the fall and rise of several [[Caliphate|Islamic caliphates]]. Arab miniaturists absorbed [[Chinese art|Chinese]] and [[Persian art|Persian]] influences brought by the [[Mongol invasion of the Middle East|Mongol destructions]], and at last, got totally assimilated and subsequently disappeared due to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation of the Arab world. Nearly all forms of Islamic miniatures ([[Persian miniature]]s, [[Ottoman miniature]]s and [[Mughal miniature]]s) owe their existences to Arabic miniatures, as Arab patrons were the first to demand the production of illuminated manuscripts in the Caliphate, it wasn't until the 14th century that the artistic skill reached the non-Arab regions of the Caliphate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Mihram |first=Danielle |title=Research Guides: Medieval Studies and Research: Manuscripts: Art &amp; Techniques |url=https://libguides.usc.edu/MedRenMSSandRareMatStudies/artandtechniques |access-date=2022-05-27 |website=libguides.usc.edu |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DavidCollection&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Miniature Painting |url=https://www.davidmus.dk/en/collections/islamic/materials/miniatures |access-date=30 December 2017 |publisher=The David Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MMA1933&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |date=October 1933 |title=Islamic Miniature Painting and Book Illumination |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3255467.pdf.bannered.pdf |journal=Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art |volume=28 |issue=10 |pages=166–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dutton |first=Yasin |date=2016 |title=Review of Qur'ans of the Umayyads: A First Overview (Leiden Studies in Islam &amp; Society), François Déroche |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44031130 |journal=Journal of Qur'anic Studies |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=153–157 |doi=10.3366/jqs.2016.0227 |issn=1465-3591 |jstor=44031130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;''La Peinture arabe''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1236-1237, he is known to have transcribed and illustrated the book, ''[[Maqamat Badi' az-Zaman al-Hamadhani|Maqamat]]'' (also known as the ''Assemblies'' or the ''Sessions''), a series of anecdotes of social satire written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Baghdad school – Islamic art |encyclopedia=Britannica |publisher=www.britannica.com |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Baghdad-school |access-date=2022-05-23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative concerns the travels of a middle-aged man as he uses his charm and eloquence to swindle his way across the Arabic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781315121970 |title=Art, Awakening, and Modernity in the Middle East |date=2017-11-22 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-315-12197-0 |editor-last=Esanu |editor-first=Octavian |doi=10.4324/9781315121970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic Architecture has a deep diverse history, it dates to the dawn of the history in [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] and includes various styles from the [[Nabataean architecture]] to the old yet still used architecture in various regions of the Arab world. Each of it phases largely
an extension of the earlier phase, it left also heavy impact on the [[Islamic architecture|architecture]] of other nations. Arab Architecture also encompasses a wide range of both secular and religious styles from the [[History of Islam|foundation of Islam]] to the present day. Some parts of its religious architectures raised by Muslim Arabs were influenced by cultures of [[Roman architecture|Roman]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]], [[Persian architecture|Persian]] and cultures of other lands which the [[Early Muslim conquests|Arab conquered]] in the 7th and 8th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krautheimer&quot;&gt;Krautheimer, Richard.

The principal Islamic architectural types are: the [[Mosque]], the [[Tomb]], the [[Palace]] and the [[Fort]].

=== Music ===
{{main|Arabic music}}
[[Arabic music]], while independent and flourishing in the 2010s, has a long history of interaction with many other regional musical styles and genres. It is an amalgam of the music of the Arab people in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and the music of all the peoples that make up the [[Arab world]] today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Touma |first=Habib Hassan |date=1972 |title=[Review of ''Das arabische Tonsystem im Mittelalter'' by Liberty Manik] |department=Book Reviews |journal=Ethnomusicology |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=140–144 |doi=10.2307/850449 |jstor=850449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-Islamic Arab music was similar to that of Ancient Middle Eastern music. Most historians agree that there existed distinct forms of music in the [[Arabian peninsula]] in the pre-Islamic period between the 5th and 7th century CE. [[Arabic poetry|Arab poets]] of that &quot;Jahili poets&quot;, meaning &quot;the poets of the period of ignorance&quot;—used to recite poems with a high notes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jahili&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |date=16 December 2004 |title=الغناء في العصر الجاهلي |url=https://www.khaledtrm.net/?p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that [[Genie|Jinns]] revealed poems to poets and music to musicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jahili&quot; /&gt; By the 11th century, [[al-Andalus|Islamic Iberia]] had become a center for the manufacture of instruments. These goods spread gradually throughout [[France]], influencing French [[troubadour]]s, and eventually reaching the rest of [[Europe]]. The English words [[lute]], [[rebec]], and [[naqareh|naker]] are derived from Arabic [[oud]], [[Rebab|rabab]], and [[naqareh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=Douglas Alton |title=A History of the Lute from Antiquity to the Renaissance |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-9714071-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=20 December 2008 |title=Asian Music Tribal Music of India, 32, 1, Fall, 2000/ Winter, 2001 |url=http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/journals/archive/am/00449202_ap030061.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220100655/http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/journals/archive/am/00449202_ap030061.html |archive-date=20 December 2008 |access-date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[musical instrument]]s used in [[classical music]] are believed to have been derived from Arabic musical instruments: the [[lute]] was derived from the ''[[Oud]]'', the [[rebec]] (ancestor of [[violin]]) from the ''[[rebab]]'', the [[guitar]] from ''qitara'', which in turn was derived from the Persian [[Tar (lute)|Tar]], [[naqareh|naker]] from ''[[naqareh]]'', [[adufe]] from ''[[Daf|al-duff]]'', [[alboka]] from ''al-buq'', [[Naffir|anafil]] from ''al-nafir'', exabeba from ''al-shabbaba'' ([[flute]]), atabal ([[bass drum]]) from ''al-tabl'', atambal from ''al-tinbal'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Farmer |first=Henry George |title=Historical facts for the Arabian Musical Influence |year=1988 |publisher=Ayer Publishing |isbn=0-405-08496-X |oclc=220811631 |author-link=Henry George Farmer}}.

and the [[theorbo]] from the ''tarab''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Farmer|1988|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s and the 1960s, Arabic music began to take on a more Western tone – artists [[Umm Kulthum]], [[Abdel Halim Hafez]], and [[Shadia]] along with composers [[Mohammed Abdel Wahab|Mohamed Abd al-Wahab]] and [[Baligh Hamdi]] pioneered the use of western instruments in Egyptian music. By the 1970s several other singers had followed suit and a strand of [[Arabic pop]] was born. Arabic pop usually consists of Western styled songs with Arabic instruments and lyrics.

[[File:Ibn Arabi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ibn Arabi]], one of the most celebrated mystic-philosophers in Islamic history.|right]]

The philosophical thought in the Arab world is heavily influenced by [[Islamic Philosophy]]. Schools of Islamic thought include [[Avicennism]] and [[Averroism]]. The first great Arab thinker in the Islamic tradition is widely regarded to be [[al-Kindi]] (801–873 A.D.), a [[Neo-Platonic]] philosopher, [[mathematician]] and [[scientist]] who lived in [[Kufa]] and [[Baghdad]] (modern day [[Iraq]]). After being appointed by the [[Abbasid Caliphs]] to translate [[Greeks|Greek]] scientific and [[philosophical]] texts into [[Arabic]], he wrote a number of original treatises of his own on a range of subjects, from [[metaphysics]] and [[ethic]]s to [[mathematic]]s and [[pharmacology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Arabic philosophy |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Arabic-philosophy |website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of his [[Philosophy|philosophical]] output focuses on [[Theology|theological]] subjects such as the nature of [[God]], the [[soul]] and [[Prophecy|prophetic]] knowledge. Doctrines of the Arabic philosophers of the 9th–12th century who influenced medieval [[Scholasticism]] in Europe. The Arabic tradition combines [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]] with other ideas introduced through [[Islam]]. Influential thinkers include the Persians [[al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]]. The Arabic philosophic literature was translated into [[Hebrew]] and [[Latin]], this contributed to the development of modern European philosophy. The Arabic tradition was developed by [[Moses Maimonides]] and [[Ibn Khaldun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Street |first=Tony |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic-language/ |title=Arabic and Islamic Philosophy of Language and Logic |date=1 January 2015 |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Arabic and Islamic Philosophy – Bibliography – PhilPapers |url=https://philpapers.org/browse/arabic-and-islamic-philosophy |website=philpapers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Science in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic science]] underwent considerable development during the 8th to 13th centuries CE, a source of knowledge that later spread throughout [[Europe]] and greatly influenced both medical practice and education. The language of recorded science was [[Arabic]]. Scientific treatises were composed by thinkers originating from across the [[Muslim world]]. These accomplishments occurred after [[Muhammad]] united the [[Tribes of Arabia|Arab tribes]] and the spread of Islam beyond the Arabian peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Falagas |first1=Matthew E. |last2=Zarkadoulia |first2=Effie A. |last3=Samonis |first3=George |date=1 August 2006 |title=Arab science in the golden age (750–1258 CE) and today |journal=The FASEB Journal |language=en |volume=20 |issue=10 |pages=1581–1586 |doi=10.1096/fj.06-0803ufm |issn=0892-6638 |pmid=16873881 |s2cid=40960150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a century after Muhammed's death (632 CE), an empire ruled by Arabs was established. It encompassed a large part of the planet, stretching from southern Europe to [[North Africa]] to [[Central Asia]] and on to [[India]]. In 711 CE, Arab Muslims invaded southern Spain; [[al-Andalus]] was a center of Arabic scientific accomplishment. Soon after, Sicily too joined the greater islamic world. Another center emerged in [[Baghdad]] from the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]], who ruled part of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] during a historic period later characterized as the &quot;[[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]]&quot; (∼750 to 1258 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Rediscovering Arabic Science {{!}} Muslim Heritage |url=http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/rediscovering-arabic-science |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220185540/http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/rediscovering-arabic-science |archive-date=20 December 2016 |access-date=18 December 2016 |website=Muslimheritage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Battani]] (c. 858 – 929; born [[Harran]], [[Bilad al-Sham]]) was an Arab astronomer, astrologer and mathematician of the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. His work is considered instrumental in the development of science and astronomy. One of Al-Battani's best-known achievements in astronomy was the determination of the solar year as being 365 days, 5 hours, 46 minutes and 24 seconds which is only 2 minutes and 22 seconds off.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacTutor&quot;&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Al-Battani|title=Abu Abdallah Mohammad ibn Jabir Al-Battani}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]], al-Battānī produced a number of [[Trigonometry|trigonometrical]] relationships:

::&lt;math&gt;\tan a = \frac{\sin a}{\cos a}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\sec a = \sqrt{1 + \tan^2 a }&lt;/math&gt;

He also solved the equation sin ''x'' = ''a'' cos ''x'' discovering the formula:

::&lt;math&gt;\sin x = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1 + a^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

He gives other trigonometric formulae for right-angled triangles such as:&lt;ref name=&quot;MacTutor&quot; /&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;b \sin (A) = a \sin (90^\circ - A)&lt;/math&gt;

Al-Battānī used [[Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi|al-Marwazi]]'s idea of [[Trigonometric function|tangents]] (&quot;shadows&quot;) to develop equations for calculating tangents and cotangents, compiling tables of them. He also discovered the reciprocal functions of secant and cosecant, and produced the first table of cosecants, which he referred to as a &quot;table of shadows&quot; (in reference to the shadow of a [[gnomon]]), for each degree from 1° to 90°.&lt;ref name=&quot;trigonometry&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=trigonometry |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/605281/trigonometry |access-date=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using these trigonometrical relationships, Al-Battānī created an equation for finding the [[qibla]], which Muslims must face in each of the five prayers they practice every day.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Glen Van Brummelen |date=2013 |title=Seeking the Divine on Earth: The Direction of Prayer in Islam |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.4169/mathhorizons.21.1.15 |journal=Math Horizons |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=15–17 |doi=10.4169/mathhorizons.21.1.15 |jstor=10.4169/mathhorizons.21.1.15 |via=JSTOR |s2cid=218543141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equation he created did not give accurate directions, as it did not take into account the fact that Earth is a sphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The relationship Al-Battānī used was fairly precise when a person is in Mecca, or close to Mecca, but resulted in more and more inaccurate results as one gets more distant from Mecca.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; However, it was still a widely used method at the time. The equation is as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\arctan\frac{\sin\Delta\lambda}{\sin\Delta\phi}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) used experimentation to obtain the results in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021), an important development in the [[history of scientific method|history of the scientific method]]. He combined [[observation]]s, [[experiment]]s and [[Rationality|rational]] arguments to support his intromission theory of [[visual perception|vision]], in which [[Ray (optics)|rays]] of [[light]] are emitted from objects rather than from the eyes. He used similar arguments to show that the ancient [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory of vision]] supported by [[Ptolemy]] and [[Euclid]] (in which the eyes emit the rays of light used for seeing), and the ancient [[intromission theory]] supported by [[Aristotle]] (where objects emit physical particles to the eyes), were both wrong.&lt;ref&gt;[[D.

The birth of the University institution can be traced to this development, as several universities and educational institutions of the Arab world such as the [[University of Al Quaraouiyine]], [[Al Azhar University]], and [[University of Ez-Zitouna|Al Zaytuna University]] are considered to be the oldest in the world. Founded by [[Fatima al-Fihri|Fatima al Fihri]] in 859 as a mosque, the University of Al Quaraouiyine in [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] is the oldest existing, continually operating and the first [[Academic degree|degree]] awarding educational institution in the world according to [[UNESCO]] and [[Guinness World Records]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Oldest university |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/3000/oldest-university |access-date=18 December 2017 |website=Guinnessworldrecords.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Medina of Fez |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/170 |access-date=7 April 2016 |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes referred to as the oldest university.&lt;ref&gt;Verger, Jacques: &quot;Patterns&quot;, in: Ridder-Symoens, Hilde de (ed.): ''A History of the University in Europe.

Under [[Ottoman rule]], cultural life and science in the [[Arab world]] declined.

=== Wedding and marriage ===
{{main|Arabic wedding}}
[[File:Tatouage au Henné, Maroc.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henna]] tattoo in [[Morocco]]]]
[[Arabic wedding]]s have changed greatly in the past 100 years. Original traditional Arabic weddings are supposed to be very similar to modern-day [[Bedouin]] weddings and rural weddings, and they are in some cases unique from one region to another, even within the same [[Arab world|country]]. The practice of [[Marriage|marrying]] of relatives is a common feature of [[Arab culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Jehad |first=Al-Omari |title=Understanding the Arab culture : a practical cross-cultural guide to working in the Arab world |date=1 January 2008 |publisher=How To Books |isbn=978-1-84803-646-8 |oclc=408662262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Arab world]] today between 40% and 50% of all marriages are [[consanguineous]] or between close family members, though these figures may vary among Arab nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Middle East Health Magazine |url=http://www.middleeasthealthmag.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi?http://www.middleeasthealthmag.com/may2012/feature2.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010101037/http://www.middleeasthealthmag.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.middleeasthealthmag.com%2Fmay2012%2Ffeature2.htm |archive-date=10 October 2017 |access-date=18 December 2017 |website=Middleeasthealthmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid24294299&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Bener A, Dafeeah EE, Samson N |year=2012 |title=Does consanguinity increase the risk of schizophrenia?

'''Armadillos''' (meaning &quot;little armored ones&quot; in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) are [[New World]] [[placental]] [[mammal]]s in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Cingulata]]. The [[Chlamyphoridae]] and [[Dasypodidae]] are the only surviving [[family (biology)|families]] in the order, which is part of the superorder [[Xenarthra]], along with the [[anteater]]s and [[sloth]]s. Nine [[extinct taxon|extinct]] [[genus|genera]] and 21 extant [[species]] of armadillo have been described, some of which are distinguished by the number of bands on their armor. All species are native to the [[Americas]], where they inhabit a variety of different environments. 
 
Armadillos are characterized by a leathery [[armour (anatomy)|armor]] shell and long, sharp claws for digging. They have short legs, but can move quite quickly. The average length of an armadillo is about {{convert|75|cm|in|abbr=on}}, including its tail. The [[giant armadillo]] grows up to {{convert|150|cm|in|abbr=on}} and weighs up to {{convert|54|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, while the [[pink fairy armadillo]] has a length of only {{convert|13|–|15|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. When threatened by a predator, ''[[Tolypeutes]]'' species frequently roll up into a ball; they are the only species of armadillo capable of this.

==Etymology==
The word ''armadillo'' means &quot;little armored one&quot; in Spanish. The [[Aztecs]] called them ''āyōtōchtli'' {{IPA-nah|aːjoːˈtoːt͡ʃt͡ɬi|}}, [[Nahuatl]] for &quot;turtle-rabbit&quot;: ''āyōtl'' {{IPA-nah|ˈaːjoːt͡ɬ|}} (turtle) and ''tōchtli'' {{IPA-nah|ˈtoːt͡ʃt͡ɬi|}} (rabbit).&lt;ref name=Karttunen1983&gt;{{cite book |last=Karttunen |first=Frances E. |author-link=Frances E.

==Evolution==
Recent genetic research suggests that an extinct group of giant armored mammals, the [[glyptodont]]s, should be included within the lineage of armadillos, having diverged some 35 million years ago, more recently than previously assumed.&lt;ref name =AMNH2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/explore/news-blogs/research-posts/study-finds-relationship-between-glyptodonts-modern-armadillos|title=Study finds relationship between glyptodonts, armadillos|publisher=AMNH|access-date=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
Like all of the Xenarthra lineages, armadillos originated in [[South America]]. Due to the continent's former isolation, they were confined there for most of the [[Cenozoic]]. The recent formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] allowed a few members of the family to migrate northward into southern [[North America]] by the early [[Pleistocene]], as part of the [[Great American Interchange]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodburne2010&quot;/&gt; (Some of their much larger [[Cingulata|cingulate]] relatives, the [[pampathere]]s and chlamyphorid [[glyptodont]]s, made the same journey.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodburne2010&quot;/&gt;

Today, all extant armadillo species are still present in South America. They are particularly diverse in [[Paraguay]] (where 11 species exist) and surrounding areas. Many species are endangered. Some, including four species of ''[[Dasypus]]'', are widely distributed over the Americas, whereas others, such as [[Yepes's mulita]], are restricted to small ranges. Two species, the [[northern naked-tailed armadillo]] and [[nine-banded armadillo]], are found in Central America; the latter has also reached the United States, primarily in the south-central states (notably Texas), but with a range that extends as far east as [[North Carolina]] and [[Florida]], and as far north as southern [[Nebraska]] and southern [[Indiana]].&lt;ref name=ExpRange/&gt; Their range has consistently expanded in North America over the last century due to a lack of natural predators. Armadillos are increasingly documented in southern [[Illinois]] and are tracking northwards due to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Armadillos have arrived in downstate Illinois and are heading north — yes, you might someday see an armadillo in your backyard |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-ent-armadillos-arrive-illinois-20220504-hhzv7szssbfotkegaxb442xu2m-story.html |access-date=2022-05-17 |website=Chicago Tribune |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics ==
===Size===
The smallest species of armadillo, the pink fairy armadillo, weighs around {{convert|85|g|oz|abbr=on}} and is {{convert|13|-|15|cm|
|abbr=on}} in total length. The largest species, the giant armadillo, can weigh up to {{convert|54|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and can be {{convert|150|cm|in|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt;

===Diet and predation===
The diets of different armadillo species vary, but consist mainly of [[insect]]s, grubs, and other [[invertebrate]]s. Some species, however, feed almost entirely on ants and termites.

They are prolific diggers. Many species use their sharp claws to dig for food, such as [[Larva|grubs]], and to dig dens. The nine-banded armadillo prefers to build burrows in moist soil near the creeks, streams, and [[arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] around which it lives and feeds.
[[File:Mani armadilli.png|thumb|right|Paws of a hairy and a giant armadillo]]
Armadillos have very poor eyesight, and use their keen sense of smell to hunt for food.&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt; They use their claws for digging and finding food, as well as for making their homes in burrows. They dig their burrows with their claws, making only a single corridor the width of the animal's body. They have five clawed toes on their hind feet, and three to five toes with heavy digging claws on their fore feet. Armadillos have numerous cheek teeth which are not divided into [[premolar]]s and [[molar (tooth)|molar]]s, but usually have no [[incisor]]s or [[canine (tooth)|canine]]s. The [[dentition]] of the nine-banded armadillo is P 7/7, M 1/1 = 32.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman&amp;Genoways&quot;/&gt;

===Body temperature===
In common with other xenarthrans, armadillos, in general, have low [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]]s of {{convert|33|-|36|C}} and low [[basal metabolic rate]]s (40–60% of that expected in placental mammals of their mass). This is particularly true of types that specialize in using termites as their primary food source (for example, ''[[Priodontes]]'' and ''[[Tolypeutes]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;McNab&quot;/&gt;

===Skin===
The armor is formed by [[plate (anatomy)|plates]] of [[dermal bone]] covered in relatively small overlapping epidermal scales called &quot;[[scute]]s&quot; which are composed of keratin.&lt;ref name=Yates&gt;{{cite web |url= https://biologydictionary.net/armadillo/ |title=Armadillo |last=Yates|first= Paige|date=30 October 2020|website=BiologyDictionary.net |publisher=Biology Dictionary|access-date=8 September 2021|quote=The plates of bone are covered in small overlapping epidermal scales called scutes, which are composed of keratin.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most species have rigid shields over the shoulders and hips, with a number of bands separated by flexible skin covering the back and flanks. Additional armor covers the top of the head, the upper parts of the limbs, and the tail. The underside of the animal is never armored, and is simply covered with soft skin and fur.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoM&quot;/&gt; This armor-like skin appears to be an important defense for many armadillos, although most escape predators by fleeing (often into thorny patches, from which their armor protects them) or digging to safety. Only the South American three-banded armadillos (''Tolypeutes'') rely heavily on their armor for protection.

===Defensive behavior===
When threatened by a [[predator]], ''Tolypeutes'' species frequently roll up into a ball. Other armadillo species cannot roll up because they have too many plates. The North American nine-banded armadillo tends to jump straight in the air when surprised, so consequently often collides with the undercarriage or fenders of passing vehicles to its demise.&lt;ref name=LOC/&gt;

===Movement===
Armadillos have short legs, but can move quite quickly.  The nine-banded armadillo is noted for its movement through water&lt;ref name=McDonough2013/&gt; which is accomplished via two different methods: it can walk underwater for short distances, holding its breath for as long as six minutes; also, to cross larger bodies of water, it is capable of increasing its buoyancy by swallowing air, inflating its stomach and intestines.&lt;ref name=Vijayaraghavan/&gt;

===Reproduction===
[[Gestation]] lasts from 60 to 120 days, depending on species, although the nine-banded armadillo also exhibits [[delayed implantation]], so the young are not typically born for eight months after mating. Most members of the genus ''Dasypus'' give birth to four [[monozygotic]] young (that is, identical quadruplets),&lt;ref name=Bagatto2000/&gt; but other species may have typical litter sizes that range from one to eight. The young are born with soft, leathery skin which hardens within a few weeks. They reach sexual maturity in three to twelve months, depending on the species. Armadillos are solitary animals that do not share their burrows with other adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoM&quot; /&gt;

==Armadillos and humans==

=== Science and education ===
Armadillos are often used in the study of [[leprosy]], since they, along with [[mangabey]] monkeys, rabbits, and mice (on their footpads), are among the few known species that can contract the disease systemically. They are particularly susceptible due to their unusually low body temperature, which is hospitable to the leprosy bacterium, ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]''. (The leprosy bacterium is difficult to culture and armadillos have a body temperature of {{convert|34|C}}, similar to human skin.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Truman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Truman|first1=Richard|title=Leprosy in wild armadillos|journal=Leprosy Review|date=2005|volume=76|issue=3|pages=198–208|doi=10.47276/lr.76.3.198 |url=http://www.lepra.org.uk/platforms/lepra/files/lr/sept05/lep198-208.pdf|access-date=4 May 2017|pmid=16248207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans can acquire a leprosy infection from armadillos by handling them or consuming armadillo meat.&lt;ref name=NYT2011/&gt; Armadillos are a presumed [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] and [[natural reservoir]] for the disease in Texas, Louisiana and Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Zoonotic Leprosy in the Southeastern United States|first1=Rahul|last1=Sharma|first2=Pushpendra|last2=Singh|first3=W.J.|last3=Loughry|first4=J. Mitchell|last4=Lockhart|first5=W. Barry|last5=Inman|first6=Malcolm S.|last6=Duthie|first7=Maria T.|last7=Pena|first8=Luis A.|last8=Marcos|first9=David M.|last9=Scollard|first10=Stewart T.|last10=Cole|first11=Richard W.|last11=Truman|date=1 December 2015|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|volume=21|issue=12|pages=2127–2134|doi=10.3201/eid2112.150501|pmid=26583204|pmc=4672434}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Truman 2011&quot;/&gt; Prior to the [[European colonization of the Americas|arrival of Europeans in the late 15th century]], leprosy was unknown in the New World. Given that armadillos are native to the New World, at some point they must have acquired the disease from old-world humans.&lt;ref name=NYT2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Truman 2011&quot; /&gt;

The armadillo is also a [[natural reservoir]] for [[Chagas disease]].&lt;ref name=Yaeger1988/&gt;

The nine-banded armadillo also serves science through its unusual reproductive system, in which four genetically identical offspring are born, the result of one original egg.&lt;ref name=&quot;ufl&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;valdosta&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamlett1933&quot;/&gt; Because they are always genetically identical, the group of four young provides a good subject for scientific, behavioral, or medical tests that need consistent biological and genetic makeup in the test subjects. This is the only reliable manifestation of [[polyembryony]] in the class [[Mammalia]], and exists only within the genus ''Dasypus'' and not in all armadillos, as is commonly believed. Other species that display this trait include parasitoid wasps, certain flatworms, and various aquatic invertebrates.&lt;ref name=&quot;valdosta&quot; /&gt;

Even though they have a leathery, tough shell, Armadillos, (mainly ''Dasypus'') are common [[roadkill]] due to their habit of jumping 3–4&amp;nbsp;ft vertically when startled, which puts them into collision with the underside of vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=How high can a nine-banded armadillo jump?|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/how-high-can-a-nine-banded-armadillo-jump/|access-date=2020-08-31|website=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildlife enthusiasts are using the northward march of the armadillo as an opportunity to educate others about the animals, which can be a burrowing nuisance to property owners and managers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ufl&quot; /&gt;

=== Culture ===
[[File:210_Museu_de_la_Música,_el_Bosc,_charango.jpg|thumb|A traditional charango made of ''armadillo'', today superseded by wooden charangos, in [[Museu de la Música de Barcelona]]]]
Armadillo shells have traditionally been used to make the back of the ''[[charango]]'', an [[Andean music|Andean]] [[lute]] instrument.

In certain parts of [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], armadillo meat is eaten; it is a popular ingredient in [[Oaxaca|Oaxaca, Mexico]]. During the [[Great Depression]], Americans were known to eat armadillo, known begrudgingly as &quot;Hoover hogs&quot;, a nod to the belief that President [[Herbert Hoover]] was responsible for the economic despair facing the nation at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://armadillo-online.org/food.html|title=Armadillos as Food|website=armadillo-online.org|access-date=2019-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2004/summer/hoover-2.html|title=The Ordeal of Herbert Hoover, Part 2|date=2016-08-15|website=National Archives|language=en|access-date=2019-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A whimsical account of ''The Beginning of the Armadillos'' is one of the chapters of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Just So Stories]]'' 1902 children's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kipling|first1=Rudyard|title=Just So Stories|date=1902|publisher=Macmillan|url=https://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/79/just-so-stories/1294/the-beginning-of-the-armadillos/|chapter=The Beginning of the Armadillos}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vocal and piano duo [[Flanders and Swann]] recorded a humorous song called &quot;The Armadillo&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite score|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/complete-flanders-&amp;-swann/oclc/973628714|title=The complete Flanders &amp; Swann|date=1996|publisher=International Music Publishers|oclc=973628714|via=Open WorldCat}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Shel Silverstein]] wrote a two-line poem called &quot;Instructions&quot; on how to bathe an armadillo in his collection ''A Light in the Attic''. The reference was &quot;use one bar of soap, a whole lot of hope, and 27 pads of [[Brillo]].&quot;

[[Antisemitism]] (prejudice against and hatred of [[Jews]]) has increased greatly in the [[Arab world]] since the beginning of the 20th century, for several reasons: the [[Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire|dissolution]] and [[Partition of the Ottoman Empire|breakdown of the Ottoman Empire]] and traditional Islamic society; European influence, brought about by [[Western world|Western]] [[imperialism]] and [[Arab Christians]];&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1986), p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nazi propaganda]] and [[relations between Nazi Germany and the Arab world]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Yadlin&quot;&gt;Yadlin, Rifka. &quot;Antisemitism&quot;.

Traditionally, [[History of the Jews under Muslim rule|Jews in the Muslim world]] were considered to be [[People of the Book]] and were subjected to ''[[dhimmi]]'' status. They were afforded relative security against [[Persecution of Jews#Middle East and Islamic antisemitism|persecution]], provided they did not contest the varying inferior social and legal status imposed on them in Islamic states.

While there were antisemitic incidents before the 20th century, during this time antisemitism in the [[Arab world]] increased greatly. During the 1930s and the 1940s several Jewish communities in the Arab world suffered from [[pogrom]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holocaust-Encyclopedia&quot; /&gt; The status of Jews in Arab countries deteriorated further at the onset of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holocaust-Encyclopedia&quot; /&gt; After the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Palestinian exodus]], the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|creation of the State of Israel]] and [[Israel]]i victories during the wars of [[Suez Crisis#Invasion|1956]] and [[Six-Day War|1967]] were a severe humiliation to Israel's opponents—primarily [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], and [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1986), p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the mid-1970s [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|the vast majority of Jews had left Arab and Muslim countries]], moving primarily to Israel, [[France]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Shenhav&gt;[[Yehouda Shenhav]] {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k7FoMi-qY4kC |title=The Arab Jews: A Postcolonial Reading of Nationalism, Religion, and Ethnicity |isbn=9780804752961 |last1=Shenhav |first1=Yehouda A. |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the exodus are varied and disputed.&lt;ref name=Shenhav/&gt;

By the 1980s, according to historian [[Bernard Lewis]], the volume of antisemitic literature published in the Arab world, and the authority of its sponsors, seemed to suggest that classical antisemitism had become an essential part of Arab intellectual life, considerably more than in late 19th- and early 20th-century France and to a degree that has been compared to [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernard Lewis 1986, p. 256&quot;&gt;Lewis, Bernard. ''Semites and Anti-Semites'', New York/London: Norton, 1986, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of [[political Islam]] during the 1980s and afterwards provided a new mutation of [[Antisemitism in Islam|Islamic antisemitism]], giving the hatred of Jews a religious component.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yadlin&quot; /&gt;

In their 2008 report on contemporary Arab-Muslim antisemitism, the Israeli [[Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center]] dates the beginning of this phenomenon to the spread of classic European [[Christian antisemitism]] into the Arab world starting in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;itic&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/malam_multimedia/English/eng_n/pdf/a_s_170408e.pdf Contemporary Arab-Muslim anti-Semitism, its Significance and Implications] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220000104/http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/malam_multimedia/English/eng_n/pdf/a_s_170408e.pdf |date=February 20, 2009}}&quot;, [[Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Israel Intelligence Heritage &amp; Commemoration Center (IICC)]], April 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] published a global survey of worldwide antisemitic attitudes, reporting that in the Middle East, 74% of adults agreed with a majority of the survey's eleven antisemitic propositions, including that &quot;Jews have too much power in international financial markets&quot; and that &quot;Jews are responsible for most of the world's wars.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/hating-the-jew-youve-never-met/|title=Hating the Jew you've never met|date=15 May 2014|work=The Times of Israel|access-date=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The ADL Global 100: An Index of Anti-Semitism |url=http://global100.adl.org/|publisher=Anti-Defamation League}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Antisemitism in Islam|History of antisemitism#Middle Ages|History of the Jews under Muslim rule}}

Jews, along with [[Christians]], [[Sabians]], and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] living under [[History of Islam|early and medieval Muslim rule]] were known as &quot;[[People of the Book]]&quot; to Muslims and subjected to the status of ''[[dhimmi]]'' (&quot;protected&quot; minority) in the [[Early Muslim conquests|lands conquered by Muslim Arabs]], a status generally applied to Non-Muslim minorities that was later also extended to other Non-Muslims like [[Sikhs]], [[Hindus]], [[Jainism|Jains]], and [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Annemarie Schimmel|year=2004|page=[https://archive.org/details/empireofgreatmug00anne/page/107 107]|title=The Empire of the Great Mughals: History, Art and Culture|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=978-1861891853|quote=The conqueror [[Muhammad bin Qasim|Muhammad Ibn Al Qasem]] gave both Hindus and Buddhists the same status as the Christians, Jews and Sabaeans the Middle East.

''Dhimmi'' were subjected to a number of restrictions, the application and severity of which varied with time and place. Restrictions included residency in [[Racial segregation|segregated quarters]], [[Jewish religious clothing#Historical background|obligation to wear distinctive clothing]] such as the [[Yellow badge]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Silverman 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Silverman |first=Eric |author-link=Eric Silverman |year=2013 |title=A Cultural History of Jewish Dress |chapter=Bitter Bonnets and Badges: Dressing the Infidel |journal=Choice Reviews Online |volume=51 |issue=2 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nZYdAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48 |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Academic]] |pages=47–50 |doi=10.5860/choice.51-1024 |isbn=978-0-857-85209-0 |s2cid=190749766}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|In many [[Muslim world|Islamic countries]], Jewish men typically wore [[tunic]]s, instead of trousers. In the same countries, many different local regulations emerged to make Christian and Jewish ''dhimmi'' look distinctive in their public appearance. In 1198, the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad caliph]] [[Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur]] decreed that Jews must wear a [[Dark blue (color)|dark blue]] garb, with very large sleeves and a grotesquely oversized hat; his son altered the colour to [[Yellow badge|yellow]], a change that may have influenced [[Yellow badge#Medieval Catholic Europe|Catholic ordinances]] some time later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silverman 2013&quot;/&gt; German ethnographer [[Erich Brauer]] (1895–1942) noted that [[Yemenite Jews|Jews in Yemen]] were not allowed to wear clothing of any color besides [[blue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brauer|first1=Erich|author-link=Erich Brauer|year=1934|title=Ethnologie der Jemenitischen Juden|location=Heidelberg|publisher=Carl Winters Kulturgeschichte Bibliothek, I.

''Dhimmi'' had to pay a special poll tax (the ''[[jizya]]''), which exempted them from military service, and also from payment of the ''[[zakat]]'' alms tax required of Muslims. In return, ''dhimmi'' were granted limited rights, including a degree of [[Toleration#Islam|tolerance]], community autonomy in personal matters, and protection from being killed outright. Jewish communities, like Christian ones, were typically constituted as semi-autonomous entities managed by their own laws and leadership, who carried the responsibility for the community towards the Muslim rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages|author=Cohen, Mark R. |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=1995|isbn=0-691-01082-X |page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgbib5exskUC&amp;q=cohen+Under+Crescent+and+Cross|access-date=April 10, 2010 |author-link=Mark R.

By medieval standards, conditions for Jews under Islam were generally more formalized and better than those of Jews in Christian lands, in part due to the sharing of minority status with Christians in these lands. There is evidence for this claim in that the status of Jews in lands with no Christian minority was usually worse than their status in lands with one. For example, there were numerous incidents of [[List of events named massacres|massacres]] and [[ethnic cleansing]] of Jews in [[North Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.theforgottenrefugees.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=39 |title = The Forgotten Refugees |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927133652/http://www.theforgottenrefugees.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=39 |archive-date=27 September 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in [[Morocco]], [[Libya]], and [[Algeria]] where eventually Jews were forced to live in [[Mellah|ghettos]].&lt;ref&gt;Roumani, Maurice. ''The Case of the Jews from Arab Countries: A Neglected Issue'', 1977, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Decrees ordering the destruction of synagogues were enacted in the Middle Ages in [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/Jews_in_Arab_lands_(gen).html |title=The Treatment of Jews in Arab/Islamic Countries |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date=February 19, 1947 |access-date=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At certain times in Yemen, Morocco, and [[History of the Jews in Baghdad|Baghdad]], Jews were [[Forced conversion#Islam|forced to convert to Islam]] or face the [[Capital punishment in Islam|death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;Bat Ye'or, ''The Dhimmi'', 1985, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation where Jews both enjoyed cultural and economic prosperity at times, but were widely persecuted at other times, was summarised by G. E. Von Grunebaum:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It would not be difficult to put together the names of a very sizable number of Jewish subjects or citizens of the Islamic area who have attained to high rank, to power, to great financial influence, to significant and recognized intellectual attainment; and the same could be done for Christians. But it would again not be difficult to compile a lengthy list of persecutions, arbitrary confiscations, attempted forced conversions, or pogroms.&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Von Grunebaum, ''Eastern Jewry Under Islam'', 1971, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Views in modernity==
Some scholars hold that Arab antisemitism in the modern world arose in the nineteenth century, against the backdrop of conflicting Jewish and Arab nationalism, and was imported into the Arab world primarily by nationalistically minded Christian Arabs (and only subsequently was it &quot;Islamized&quot;), Mark Cohen states.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Studies'', p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Bernard Lewis]]:
{{blockquote|The volume of anti-Semitic books and articles published, the size and number of editions and impressions, the eminence and authority of those who write, publish and sponsor them, their place in school and college curricula, their role in the mass media, would all seem to suggest that classical anti-Semitism is an essential part of Arab intellectual life at the present time-almost as much as happened in Nazi Germany, and considerably more than in late nineteenth and early twentieth century France.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bernard Lewis 1986, p. 256&quot; /&gt;}}

===19th century===
The [[Damascus affair]] was an accusation of [[ritual murder]] and a [[blood libel]] against Jews in [[Damascus]] in 1840. On February 5, 1840, [[Franciscan]] [[Capuchin friar]] Father Thomas and his Greek servant were reported missing, never to be seen again. The [[Turkey|Turkish]] governor and the French consul [[Ratti-Menton]] believed accusations of ritual murder and blood libel, as the alleged murder occurred before the Jewish [[Passover]]. An investigation was staged, and Solomon Negrin, a Jewish barber, [[Forced confession|confessed under torture]] and accused other Jews. Two other Jews died under torture, and one (Moses Abulafia) converted to [[Islam]] to escape torture. More arrests and atrocities followed, culminating in 63 Jewish children being held [[hostage]] and mob attacks on Jewish communities throughout the Middle East. International outrage led to [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] in Egypt ordering an investigation. Negotiations in [[Alexandria]] eventually secured the unconditional release and recognition of innocence of the nine prisoners still remaining alive (out of thirteen). Later in [[Constantinople]], [[Moses Montefiore]] (leader of the British Jewish community) persuaded Sultan [[Abdülmecid I]] to issue a [[firman (decree)|firman]] (edict) intended to halt the spread of blood libel accusations in the [[Ottoman Empire]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... and for the love we bear to our subjects, we cannot permit the Jewish nation, whose innocence for the crime alleged against them is evident, to be worried and tormented as a consequence of accusations which have not the least foundation in truth....
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, the [[blood libel]] spread through the Middle East and North Africa: Aleppo (1810, 1850, 1875), Damascus ([[Damascus affair|1840]], 1848, 1890), Beirut (1862, 1874), Dayr al-Qamar (1847), Jerusalem (1847), Cairo (1844, 1890, 1901–02), Mansura (1877), Alexandria (1870, 1882, 1901–02), Port Said (1903, 1908), and Damanhur (1871, 1873, 1877, 1892).&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard.

The [[Dreyfus affair]] of the late 19th century had consequences in the Arab world. Passionate outbursts of antisemitism in France were echoed in areas of French influence, especially [[Maronite]] [[Lebanon]]. The Muslim Arab press, however, was sympathetic to the falsely accused Captain Dreyfus, and criticized the persecution of Jews in France.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1986), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pre-state antisemitism ====
While Arab antisemitism has increased in the wake of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], there were [[pogrom]]s against Jews prior to the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|establishment of the State of Israel in May 1948]], including [[Nazism|Nazi]]-inspired pogroms in [[Algeria]] in the 1930s, and attacks on the Jews of [[Iraq]] and [[Libya]] in the 1940s. In 1941, 180 Jews were murdered and 700 were injured in the anti-Jewish riots known as &quot;the [[Farhud]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;haaretz&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Zvi Zameret|date=October 29, 2010 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/a-distorted-historiography-1.321731 |title=A distorted historiography |newspaper=Haaretz |access-date=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four hundred Jews were injured in violent demonstrations in Egypt in 1945 and Jewish property was vandalized and looted. In Libya, 130 Jews were killed and 266 injured. In December 1947, 13 Jews were killed in Damascus, including 8 children, and 26 were injured. In Aleppo, rioting resulted in dozens of Jewish casualties, damage to 150 Jewish homes, and the torching of 5 schools and 10 synagogues. In Yemen, 97 Jews were murdered and 120 injured.&lt;ref name=&quot;haaretz&quot;/&gt;

==== Speculated causes ====
Antisemitism in the [[Arab world]] increased in the 20th century, as resentment against [[Aliyah|Jewish immigration]] and [[Zionism|Zionist]] activities in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine Mandate]] grew. Around this time, the [[Antisemitic canard|fabricated antisemitic text]] ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' started to become available in Palestine. A translation of the text in Arabic was done by an Arab Christian in [[Cairo]] in 1927 or 1928, this time as a published book.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hadassa Ben-Itto]], ''The Lie that Wouldn't Die: The Protocols of The Elders of Zion'', p. 280 (London: Vallentine Mitchell, 2005). {{ISBN|0-85303-602-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis 1986&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Lewis|first=Bernard|author-link=Bernard Lewis|title=Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry into Conflict and Prejudice|year=1986|publisher=WW Norton &amp; Co.|isbn=978-0-393-02314-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/semitesantisemit00lewi/page/199 199]|url=https://archive.org/details/semitesantisemit00lewi/page/199 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1921, Musa Khazem El Husseini, Mayor of Jerusalem, told [[Winston Churchill]] &quot;The Jews have been amongst the most active advocates of destruction in many lands. ... It is well known that the disintegration of Russia was wholly or in great part brought about by the Jews, and a large proportion of the defeat of Germany and Austria must also be put at their door.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Morris, Benny, ''Righteous Victims'', Knopf, 1999, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matthias Küntzel]] has suggested that the decisive transfer of [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitism|Jewish conspiracy theory]] took place between 1937 and 1945 under the impact of Nazi propaganda targeted at the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;Küntzel, Matthias, &quot;National Socialism and Anti-Semitism in the Arab World&quot;, ''Jewish Political Studies Review'' 17:1–2 (Spring 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kuntzel, the Nazi Arabic radio service had a staff of 80 and broadcast every day in Arabic, stressing the similarities between Islam and Nazism and supported by the activities of the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]], [[Amin al-Husseini]] (who broadcast pro-Nazi propaganda from Berlin).&lt;ref name=&quot;Herf 2009&quot;/&gt; Alongside al-Husseini's [[Nazi collaborator|collaboration with the Nazis]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Holocaust-Encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JCPA 2020&quot;/&gt; cooperative political and military relationships between the Arab world and the [[Axis powers]] ([[Nazi Germany]] and [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]]) were founded on shared antisemitic scorn and hostilities toward common enemies: the [[United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and [[Zionism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Herf 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Holocaust-Encyclopedia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JCPA 2020&quot;/&gt; The Nazi regime also provided funding to the Egyptian [[Moslem Brotherhood]], which began calling for boycotts of Jewish businesses in 1936.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}
Bernard Lewis also describes Nazi influence in the Arab world, including its impact on [[Michel Aflaq]], the principal founder of [[Ba'athism|Ba'athist thought]] (which later dominated Syria and Iraq).&lt;blockquote&gt; After the promulgation of the Nuremberg Laws, Hitler received telegrams of congratulation from all over the Arab and Muslim world, especially from Morocco and Palestine, where the Nazi propaganda had been most active.... Before long political parties of the Nazi and Fascist type began to appear, complete with paramilitary youth organizations, colored shirts, strict discipline and more or less charismatic leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]].

George Gruen attributes the increased animosity towards Jews in the [[Arab world]] to the [[Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire|defeat and breakdown of the Ottoman Empire]] and traditional [[Muslim world|Islamic society]]; domination by [[European colonialism|Western colonial powers]] under which Jews gained a disproportionately large role in the commercial, professional, and administrative life of the region; the rise of [[Arab nationalism]], whose proponents sought the wealth and positions of local Jews through government channels; resentment over [[Zionism|Jewish nationalism]] and the Zionist movement; and the readiness of unpopular Arab [[regime]]s to [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]] local Jews for political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Gruen, George E. [http://www.jcpa.org/jl/jl102.htm &quot;The Other Refugees: Jews of the Arab World&quot;], ([[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Palestinian exodus]], the creation of the state of [[Israel]], and the independence of Arab countries from European control, conditions for Jews in the Arab world deteriorated. Over the next few decades, almost all would flee the Arab world, some willingly, and some under threat (see [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]]). In 1945 there were between 758,000 and 866,000 Jews (see table below) living in communities throughout the Arab world. Today, there are fewer than 8,000. In some Arab states, such as [[Libya]] (which was once around 3% Jewish), the Jewish community no longer exists; in other Arab countries, only a few hundred Jews remain.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Virtual Library: [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/myths3/MFrefugees.html Chapter 12: Refugees]&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard University Professor [[Ruth R. Wisse]] claims that &quot;anti-Semitism / Zionism has been the cornerstone of pan-Arab politics since the Second World War&quot; and that it is the &quot;strongest actual and potential source of unity&quot; in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;Wisse, Ruth R. [https://nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-functions-of-anti-semitism &quot;The Functions of Anti-Semitism.&quot;] ''National Affairs''. Fall 2017. 2 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because Jews and Israel function as substitutes for Western values that challenge the hegemony of religious and political power in the Middle East. Antisemitism is also malleable enough that it can unite right-wing and left-wing groups within the Arab world.

[[Robert L. Bernstein|Robert Bernstein]], founder of [[Human Rights Watch]], says that antisemitism is &quot;deeply ingrained and institutionalized&quot; in &quot;Arab nations in modern times&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-do-human-rights-groups-ignore-palestinians-war-of-words/2011/09/26/gIQAWU5y2K_story.html| title = Why do human rights groups ignore Palestinians' war of words?| newspaper = [[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary attitudes===

====Israeli Arabs====
{{see also|Racism against Israeli Jews by Israeli Arabs}}
In 2003, Israeli-Arab [[Raed Salah]], the leader of the northern branch of the [[Islamic Movement in Israel]] published the following poem in the Islamic Movement's periodical:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You Jews are criminal bombers of mosques,&lt;br /&gt;
Slaughterers of pregnant women and babies.&lt;br /&gt;
Robbers and germs in all times,&lt;br /&gt;
The Creator sentenced you to be loser monkeys,&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During a speech in 2007, Salah accused Jews of [[blood libel|using children's blood to bake bread]]. &quot;We have never allowed ourselves to knead [the dough for] the bread that breaks the fast in the holy month of Ramadan with children's blood,&quot; he said. &quot;Whoever wants a more thorough explanation, let him ask what used to happen to some children in Europe, whose blood was mixed in with the dough of the [Jewish] holy bread.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stern |first=Yoav |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/islamic-movement-head-charged-with-incitement-to-racism-violence-1.238209 |title=Islamic Movement head charged with incitement to racism, violence |newspaper=Haaretz |date=February 16, 2007 |access-date=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all groups surveyed, a 2010 Pew Research global poll found that Israeli Arabs have the lowest rate of anti-Jewish attitudes in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |chapter=Views of Religious Groups |title=Mixed Views of Hamas and Hezbollah in Largely Muslim Nations |chapter-url=https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2010/02/04/chapter-3-views-of-religious-groups/ |publisher=Pew Research Center |access-date=21 September 2021 |date=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Egypt====
{{see also|Antisemitism in Africa#Egypt|History of the Jews in Egypt}}
Egyptian [[Muslim Brotherhood]] leader [[Mohammed Mahdi Akef]] has denounced what he called &quot;the myth of [[the Holocaust]]&quot; in defending Iranian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s [[Holocaust denial|denial]] of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4554986.stm &quot;Egyptian Islamists deny Holocaust&quot;], ''[[BBC News]]'', December 23, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Egypt]]ian government-run newspaper, ''[[Al Akhbar (Egypt)|Al Akhbar]]'', on April 29, 2002, published an editorial denying [[the Holocaust]] as a fraud. The next paragraph decries the failure of the Holocaust to eliminate all of the Jews:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
With regard to the fraud of the Holocaust.... Many French studies have proven that this is no more than a fabrication, a lie, and a fraud!! That is, it is a 'scenario' the plot of which was carefully tailored, using several faked photos completely unconnected to the truth. Yes, it is a film, no more and no less. Hitler himself, whom they accuse of Nazism, is in my eyes no more than a modest 'pupil' in the world of murder and bloodshed. He is completely innocent of the charge of frying them in the hell of his false Holocaust!!

The entire matter, as many French and British scientists and researchers have proven, is nothing more than a huge Israeli plot aimed at extorting the German government in particular and the European countries in general. But I, personally and in light of this imaginary tale, complain to Hitler, even saying to him from the bottom of my heart, 'If only you had done it, brother, if only it had really happened, so that the world could sigh in relief [without] their evil and sin.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an article in October 2000 columnist [[Adel Hammoda]] alleged in the state-owned Egyptian newspaper ''[[al-Ahram]]'' that Jews made [[Matza]] from the blood of (non-Jewish) children.&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Ahram'' (Egypt), October 28, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Mohammed Salmawy, editor of ''[[Al-Ahram Hebdo]]'', &quot;defended the use of old European myths like the [[blood libel against Jews|blood libel]]&quot; in his newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Kate (August 10, 2003).

{{See also|History of the Jews in Jordan}}
[[Jordan]] does not allow entry to Jews with visible signs of Judaism or even with personal religious items in their possession.

====Saudi Arabia====
{{Main|Antisemitism in Saudi Arabia}}

Hostility toward Jews is common in Saudi Arabian media, religious sermons, school curriculum, and official government policy.

Indoctrination against Jews is a part of school curriculum in Saudi Arabia.  Children are advised not to befriend Jews, are given false information about them (such as the claim that Jews worship the Devil), and are encouraged to engage in ''jihad'' against Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shea |first=Nina |author-link=Nina Shea |title=This is a Saudi textbook.

====Syria====
[[File:Zeibak.jpg|thumb|upright|Clockwise from top left: Fara Zeibak, Mazal Zeibak, Eva Saad and Lulu Zeibak.]]

On March 2, 1974, the bodies of four [[Syrian Jewish]] women were discovered by border police in a cave in the Zabdani Mountains northwest of Damascus. Fara Zeibak 24, her sisters Lulu Zeibak 23, Mazal Zeibak 22 and their cousin Eva Saad 18, had contracted with a band of smugglers to flee Syria to Lebanon and eventually to Israel. The girls' bodies were found raped, murdered and mutilated. The police also found the remains of two Jewish boys, Natan Shaya 18 and Kassem Abadi 20, victims of an earlier massacre.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Saul S. (1989).

In 1984 Syrian Defense Minister [[Mustafa Tlass]] published a book called ''The Matzah of Zion'', which claimed that Jews had killed Christian children in Damascus to make Matzas (see [[Damascus affair]]). His book inspired the Egyptian TV series ''[[Horseman Without a Horse]]'' (see below) and a spinoff, ''The Diaspora'', which led to [[Hezbollah]]'s al-Manar being banned in Europe for broadcasting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jorisch, Avi|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KdBkAAAAMAAJ|title=Beacon of Hatred: Inside Hizballahs Al-Manar Television|publisher=Washington Institute for Near East Policy|isbn=0-944029-88-4|pages=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tunisia====
For a personal account of the discrimination and physical attacks experienced by Jews in Tunisia the Jewish-Arab anti-colonialist writer [[Albert Memmi]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Memmi, Albert.[http://www.jimena.org/faq/memmi.htm &quot;Who is an Arab Jew?&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120132211/http://www.jimena.org/faq/memmi.htm |date=November 20, 2008 }}, February 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
At each crisis, with every incident of the slightest importance, the mob would go wild, setting fire to Jewish shops. This even happened during the Yom Kippur War. Tunisia's President, Habib Bourguiba, has in all probability never been hostile to the Jews, but there was always that notorious &quot;delay&quot;, which meant that the police arrived on the scene only after the shops had been pillaged and burnt. Is it any wonder that the exodus to France and Israel continued and even increased?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On November 30, 2012, prominent Tunisian imam Sheikh Ahmad Al-Suhayli of [[Radès]], told his followers during a live broadcast on [[Hannibal TV]] that &quot;God wants to destroy this [Tunisian] sprinkling of Jews and is sterilizing the wombs of Jewish women.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;timesofisrael.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.timesofisrael.com/tunisian-imam-sued-for-call-to-sterilize-the-wombs-of-jewish-women/| title = Tunisian imam sued for call to 'sterilize the wombs of Jewish women' Times of Israel.

On January 18, 2021, Tunisian president [[Kais Saied]] was caught on video telling a crowd that &quot;We know very well who the people are who are controlling the country today. It is the Jews who are doing the stealing, and we need to put an end to it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2021-03-03|title=The President of Tunisia Slanders the Jews|url=https://besacenter.org/tunisia-kais-saied-jews/|access-date=2022-02-08|website=Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saied's office responded that the president's words had been misheard and that he meant to say something else instead of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Agencies|title=Tunisian president denies claims he made anti-Semitic remarks|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/tunisian-president-denies-claims-he-made-anti-semitic-remarks/|access-date=2022-02-08|website=www.timesofisrael.com|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Saied publicly apologized for his statements, holding a phone call with [[Djerba]]'s chief rabbi, [[Haim Bitan]] in which he expressed regret for his statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tunisian president sorry for antisemitic remarks, rabbi says|url=https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/tunisian-president-blames-instability-on-stealing-jews-656062|access-date=2022-02-08|website=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[history of the Jews in Tunisia]] goes back to Roman times. Before 1948, the Jewish population of Tunisia reached a peak of 110,000. Today it has a Jewish community of less than 2,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ettinger |first=Yair |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/sociologist-claude-sitbon-do-the-jews-of-tunisia-have-reason-to-be-afraid-1.337440 |title=Sociologist Claude Sitbon, do the Jews of Tunisia have reason to be afraid? - Israel News &amp;#124; Haaretz Daily Newspaper |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2011-01-17 |access-date=2015-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Palestinian territories====
{{Further|Racism in the State of Palestine#Antisemitism in Palestinian territories}}

The [[Hamas]], an offshoot of the Egyptian [[Muslim Brotherhood]], has a foundational statement of principles, or &quot;covenant&quot; that claims that the French revolution, the Russian revolution, colonialism and both world wars were created by the Zionists. It also claims the [[Freemason]]s and [[Rotary club]]s are Zionist fronts and refers to the [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/hamas.htm |title=Hamas Covenant 1988 articles 22 and 32 |publisher=Yale.edu |access-date=July 2, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170055/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/hamas.htm |archive-date=June 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Claims that Jews and Freemasons were behind the French Revolution originated in Germany in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Cohn|Cohn, Norman]]. ''[[Warrant for Genocide]], The Myth of the Jewish World Conspiracy and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion'', chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahmoud Abbas]], leader of the [[PLO]], published a Ph.D. thesis (at Moscow University) in 1982, called ''The Secret Connection between the Nazis and the Leaders of the Zionist Movement''.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, Brynn. [http://hnn.us/articles/1414.html Was Abu Mazen a Holocaust Denier?], History News Network.&lt;/ref&gt;
His doctoral thesis later became a book, [[The Other Side: the Secret Relationship Between Nazism and Zionism]], which, following his appointment as Palestinian Prime Minister in 2003, was heavily criticized as an example of [[Holocaust denial]]. In his book, Abbas wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It seems that the interest of the Zionist movement, however, is to inflate this figure [of Holocaust deaths] so that their gains will be greater. This led them to emphasize this figure [six million] in order to gain the solidarity of international public opinion with Zionism. Many scholars have debated the figure of six million and reached stunning conclusions—fixing the number of Jewish victims at only a few hundred thousand.&lt;ref&gt;Medoff, Dr. Rafael.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Lebanon====
[[Hezbollah]]'s [[Al-Manar]] TV channel has often been accused of airing antisemitic broadcasts, blaming the Jews for a Zionist [[conspiracy theories in the Arab world|conspiracy against the Arab world]], and often airing excerpts from the ''Protocols of the Elders of Zion'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sciolino |first=Elaine |author2=Carole Corm |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E7DE1031F93AA35751C1A9629C8B63 |title=A New French Headache: When Is Hate on TV Illegal? |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 9, 2004 |access-date=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/protocols/protocols_recycled.asp |title=Anti-Semitic Series on Arab Television: Satellite Network Recycles The Protocols of the Elders of Zion |publisher=Anti-Defamation League |date=January 9, 2004 |access-date=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiesenthal.com/siteapps/advocacy/ActionItem.aspx?c=fwLYKnN8LzH&amp;b=297065 &quot;Urge President Chirac to Block Hezbollah's Antisemitic and Hate TV&quot;.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010194739/http://www.wiesenthal.com/siteapps/advocacy/ActionItem.aspx?c=fwLYKnN8LzH&amp;b=297065 |date=October 10, 2007 }} ''[[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]''. May 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; which the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' describes as a &quot;fraudulent document that served as a pretext and rationale for anti-Semitism in the early 20th century&quot;.

[[Al-Manar]] recently aired a drama series, called ''The Diaspora'', which is based on historical antisemitic allegations. BBC reporters who watched the series said that: &lt;blockquote&gt; Correspondents who have viewed ''The Diaspora'' note that it quotes extensively from the ''Protocols of the Elders of Zion'', a notorious 19th-century publication used by the Nazis among others to fuel race hatred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3581514.stm &quot;France offers 'hate TV' reprieve&quot;], ''BBC News Online'', August 20, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another incident, an Al-Manar commentator recently referred to &quot;Zionist attempts to transmit [[AIDS]] to Arab countries&quot;. Al-Manar officials deny broadcasting antisemitic incitement and state that their position is anti-Israeli, not antisemitic. However, Hezbollah has directed strong rhetoric both against Israel and Jews, and it has cooperated in publishing and distributing outright antisemitic literature. The government of Lebanon has not criticized continued broadcast of antisemitic material on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/nea/136073.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315152840/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/nea/136073.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 15, 2010 |title=2009 Human Rights Report: Lebanon |publisher=State.gov |date=March 11, 2010 |access-date=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to protests by the [[Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France|CRIF]] umbrella group of French Jews regarding allegations of antisemitic content, French Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] called for a ban on Al-Manar broadcasting in France on December 2, 2004; just two weeks after al-Manar was authorised to continue broadcasting in Europe by France's media watchdog agency.&lt;ref&gt;Usher, Sebastian (December 3, 2004) .[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4064317.stm &quot;French seek 'anti-Semitic' TV ban&quot;], ''[[BBC News]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 13, 2004, France's highest administrative court banned Hizbullah's Al-Manar TV station on the grounds that it consistently incites racial hatred and antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4093579.stm &quot;France pulls plug on Arab network&quot;], ''[[BBC News]] Online'', December 14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yemen====
{{see also|Geography of antisemitism#Yemen}}
The 1940s and the [[Decleration of Israel|establishment of Israel]] saw rapid emigration of Jews out of Yemen, in the wake of anti-Jewish riots and massacres. By the late 1990s, only several hundred remained, mainly in a northwestern mountainous region named [[Sa'ada]] and town of [[Raida (town)|Raida]]. [[Houthi]] members put up notes on the Jews' doors, accusing them of corrupting Muslim morals. Eventually, the Houthi leaders sent threatening messages to the Jewish community: &quot;We warn you to leave the area immediately.... We give you a period of 10 days, or you will regret it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://fighthatred.com/recent-events/national-political-hate/416-jews-flee-yemen-due-to-rising-anti-semitism |title = Jews flee Yemen due to rising anti-Semitism, Fight Hartred |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710042018/http://fighthatred.com/recent-events/national-political-hate/416-jews-flee-yemen-due-to-rising-anti-semitism |archive-date=10 July 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 March 2021, 13 Jews were forced by the Houthis to leave Yemen, leaving four elderly Jews the only Jews still in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2021/03/houthis-deport-some-yemens-last-remaining-jews| title = Houthis deport some of Yemen's last remaining Jews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arab newspapers====
Many [[Arab]] newspapers, such as ''[[Al-Hayat Al-Jadidah]]'', the Palestinian Authority's official newspaper, often write that &quot;the Jews&quot; control all the world's governments, and that &quot;the Jews&quot; plan [[genocide]] on all the Arabs in the [[West Bank]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Others write less sensational stories, and state that Jews have too much of an influence in the United States government. Often the leaders of other nations are said to be controlled by Jews.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} Articles in many official Arab government newspapers claim that ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', reflects facts, and thus points to an international Jewish conspiracy to [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|take over the world]].

{{blockquote|Netanyahu's Plan completely matches the foundations of the greater Zionist plan which is organized according to specific stages that were determined when ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' was composed and when Herzl along with Weizmann traveled around the world in order to determine the appropriate location for the implementation of this conspiracy, (official Palestinian Authority newspaper, Al-Hayat Al-Jadidah, November 30, 1997).}}

====''Horseman Without a Horse''====
In 2001–2002, [[Arab Radio and Television Network|Arab Radio and Television]] produced a 30-part television miniseries entitled ''Horseman Without a Horse'', starring prominent Egyptian actor [[Mohamed Sobhi (actor)|Mohamed Sobhi]], which contains dramatizations of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''. The United States and Israel criticized Egypt for airing the program, which includes racist falsehoods that have a history of being used &quot;as a pretext for persecuting Jews&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2386767.stm &quot;Egypt criticised for 'anti-Semitic' film&quot;], ''[[BBC News]] Online'', November 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opinion polling====
In 2008 a [[Pew Research Center]] survey found that negative views concerning Jews were most common in the three predominantly Arab nations polled, with 97% of Lebanese having unfavorable opinion of Jews, 95% in Egypt and 96% in Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewglobal.org/files/pdf/262.pdf Unfavorable Views of Jews and Muslims on the increase in Europe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171218070018/http://www.pewglobal.org/files/pdf/262.pdf |date=December 18, 2017 }} Pew Global Attitudes Research September 17, 2008, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''aardwolf''' ('''''Proteles cristata''''') is an [[insectivore|insectivorous]] species of [[hyena]], native to [[East Africa|East]] and [[Southern Africa]]. Its name means &quot;earth-wolf&quot; in [[Afrikaans]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dsae.co.za/entry/aardwolf/e00016 &quot;Aardwolf, n.&quot;] ''Dictionary of South African English''.

Unlike many of its relatives in the order [[Carnivora]], the aardwolf does not hunt large [[animal]]s. It eats [[insect]]s and their [[larva]]e,&lt;ref name=&quot;wff&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|1998|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly [[termite]]s; one aardwolf can lap up as many as 250,000 termites during a single night using its long, sticky tongue. The aardwolf's tongue has adapted to be tough enough to withstand the strong bite of termites.&lt;ref name=mh71/&gt;

The aardwolf lives in the [[shrubland]]s of eastern and southern Africa – open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs. It is [[nocturnal]], resting in [[burrow]]s during the day and emerging at night to seek food.

==Taxonomy==
The aardwolf is generally classified with the hyena family [[Hyaenidae]], though it was formerly placed in its own family Protelidae.{{refn|group=nb|Some sources such as Coetzee in Meester and Setzer (1977), Köhler and Ricardson (1990), and Yalden, Largen, and Koch (1980), classify the aardwolf in its own family still.&lt;ref name=w1&gt;{{harvnb|Nowak|2005|pp=222–223}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Early on, scientists felt that it was merely mimicking the [[striped hyena]], which subsequently led to the creation of Protelidae.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brottman|2012|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have suggested that the aardwolf probably diverged from other hyaenids early on; how early is still unclear, as the fossil record and genetic studies disagree by 10 million years.&lt;ref name=koe&gt;{{harvnb|Koepfli|Jenks|Eizirik|Zahirpour|2006|p=615}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn| group = nb |The fossil record shows 18–20 mya, and genetic studies indicate roughly 10.6 mya.&lt;ref name=koe/&gt;}}

The aardwolf is the only surviving species in the [[subfamily]] Protelinae. There is disagreement as to whether the species is [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]],&lt;ref name=Woz&gt;{{harvnb|Wozencraft|2005|p=573}}&lt;/ref&gt; or can be divided into [[subspecies]] ''P. c. cristatus'' of [[Southern Africa]] and ''P. c. septentrionalis'' of [[East Africa]].&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt;&lt;ref name=mh33/&gt;

A 2006 molecular analysis indicates that it is phylogenetically the most basal of the four extant hyaenidae species.{{sfn|Koepfli|Jenks|Eizirik|Zahirpour|2006}}

The [[genus|generic]] name ''proteles'' comes from two words both of [[Greek language|Greek]] origin, ''protos'' and ''teleos'' which combined means &quot;complete in front&quot; based on the fact that they have five toes on their front feet and four on the rear.&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt; The specific name, ''cristatus'', comes from [[Latin]] and means &quot;provided with a comb&quot;, relating to their mane.&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt;

==Description==

[[File:Aardwolf, Proteles cristata, at Lion and Rhino Reserve, Gauteng, South Africa (47987248651).jpg|thumb|Aardwolf with tongue exposed. Note the prominent [[Lingual papillae|papillae]]]]
The aardwolf resembles a very thin [[striped hyena]], but with a more slender [[snout|muzzle]], black vertical stripes on a coat of yellowish fur, and a long, distinct [[wikt:mane|mane]] down the midline of the neck and back. It also has one or two diagonal stripes down the fore- and hind-quarters, along with several stripes on its legs.&lt;ref name=mh33&gt;{{harvnb|Mills|Harvey|2001|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mane is raised during confrontations to make the aardwolf appear larger. It is missing the throat spot that others in the family have.&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt; Its lower leg (from the knee down) is all black, and its tail is bushy with a black tip.&lt;ref name=w1/&gt;

The aardwolf is about {{cvt|55|to|80|cm}} long, excluding its bushy tail, which is about {{cvt|20|-|30|cm}} long,&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=w1/&gt; and stands about {{cvt|40|to|50|cm}} tall at the shoulders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colliers&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Goodwin|1997|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adult aardwolf weighs approximately {{cvt|7|–|10|kg}}, sometimes reaching {{convert|15|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=ingo&gt;{{harvnb|Rieger|1990|pp=570–571}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aardwolves in the south of the continent tend to be smaller (about {{cvt|10|kg}}) than the eastern version (around {{cvt|14|kg}}). This makes the aardwolf, the smallest extant member of the Hyaenidae family.&lt;ref name=mh33/&gt; The front feet have five toes each, unlike the four-toed hyena.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brottman|2012|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teeth and skull are similar to those of other hyenas, though smaller,&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; and its cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; It does still have canines, but, unlike other hyenas, these teeth are used primarily for fighting and defense.&lt;ref name=w1/&gt; Its ears, which are large,&lt;ref name=w1/&gt; are very similar to those of the striped hyena.&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt;

As an aardwolf ages, it will normally lose some of its teeth, though this has little impact on its feeding habits due to the softness of the insects that it eats.&lt;ref name=&quot;wff&quot; /&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
Aardwolves live in open, dry plains and [[bushland]], avoiding mountainous areas.&lt;ref name=w1/&gt; Due to their specific food requirements, they are only found in regions where termites of the family [[Hodotermitidae]] occur. Termites of this family depend on dead and withered grass and are most populous in heavily grazed [[grassland]]s and [[savannah]]s, including [[arable land|farmland]]. For most of the year, aardwolves spend time in shared territories consisting of up to a dozen dens, which are occupied for six weeks at a time.&lt;ref name=&quot;wff&quot; /&gt;

There are two distinct populations: one in Southern Africa, and another in East and Northeast Africa. The species does not occur in the intermediary [[miombo]] forests.

An adult pair, along with their most-recent offspring, occupies a territory of {{convert|1|-|4|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=mh108&gt;{{harvnb|Mills|Harvey|2001|pp=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior and ecology==
[[Image:Aardwolf.jpg|thumb|left|Aardwolf at the [[San Antonio Zoo and Aquarium|San Antonio Zoo]]]]
Aardwolves are shy and [[nocturnal animal|nocturnal]], sleeping in burrows by day.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; They will, on occasion during the winter, become diurnal feeders. This happens during the coldest periods as they then stay in at night to conserve heat.&lt;ref name=br30&gt;{{harvnb|Brottman|2012|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have often been mistaken for solitary animals. In fact, they live as [[monogamous pairing in animals|monogamous pairs]] with their young.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richardson&quot;&gt;Richardson, P. R. K. &quot;[https://journals.co.za/content/sajsci/83/7/AJA00382353_5361?crawler=true&amp;mimetype=application/pdf Aardwolf mating system: overt cuckoldry in an apparently monogamous mammal].&quot; South African Journal of Science 83.7 (1987): 405.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;koel&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Koehler|Richardson|1990|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; If their territory is infringed upon, they will chase the intruder up to {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} or to the border.&lt;ref name=mh108/&gt; If the intruder is caught, which rarely happens,&lt;ref name=mh108/&gt; a fight will occur, which is accompanied by soft clucking,&lt;ref name=br31/&gt; hoarse barking, and a type of roar.&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt; The majority of incursions occur during mating season, when they can occur once or twice per week.&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt; When food is scarce, the stringent territorial system may be abandoned and as many as three pairs may occupy a single territory.&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt;

The territory is marked by both sexes, as they both have developed anal glands from which they extrude a black substance that is smeared on rocks or grass stalks in {{convert|5|mm|in|adj=on}}-long streaks.&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt; Aardwolves also have scent glands on the forefoot and penile pad.&lt;ref&gt;Stoeckelhuber, Mechthild, Alexander Sliwa, and Ulrich Welsch. &quot;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0185(20000701)259:3%3C312::AID-AR80%3E3.0.CO;2-X/full Histo‐physiology of the scent‐marking glands of the penile pad, anal pouch, and the forefoot in the aardwolf (Proteles cristatus)].&quot; The anatomical record 259.3 (2000): 312-326.&lt;/ref&gt; They often mark near termite mounds within their territory every 20 minutes or so. If they are patrolling their territorial boundaries, the marking frequency increases drastically, to once every {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}}. At this rate, an individual may mark 60 marks per hour,&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt; and upwards of 200 per night.&lt;ref name=mh108/&gt;

An aardwolf pair may have up to 10 dens, and numerous feces [[Midden#Other definitions|midden]]s, within their territory. When they deposit excreta at their middens, they dig a small hole and cover it with sand. Their dens are usually abandoned [[aardvark]], [[springhare]], or [[Old World porcupine|porcupine]] dens,&lt;ref name=br31&gt;{{harvnb|Brottman|2012|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; or on occasion they are crevices in rocks. They will also dig their own dens, or enlarge dens started by [[springhare]]s.&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt; They typically will only use one or two dens at a time, rotating through all of their dens every six months. During the summer, they may rest outside their den during the night, and sleep underground during the heat of the day.

Aardwolves are not fast runners nor are they particularly adept at fighting off predators. Therefore, when threatened, the aardwolf may attempt to mislead its foe by doubling back on its tracks. If confronted, it may raise its mane in an attempt to appear more menacing. It also emits a foul-smelling liquid from its anal glands.&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt;

===Feeding===
The aardwolf feeds primarily on termites and more specifically on ''[[Trinervitermes]]''.&lt;ref name=mh71&gt;{{harvnb|Mills|Harvey|2001|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; This genus of termites has different species throughout the aardwolf's range. In East Africa, they eat ''[[Trinervitermes bettonianus]]'', in central Africa, they eat ''[[Trinervitermes rhodesiensis]]'', and in southern Africa, they eat ''[[Trinervitermes trinervoides|T. trinervoides]]''.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref name=mh71/&gt;&lt;ref name=PKR&gt;{{harvnb|Richardson|Bearder|1984|pp=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their technique consists of licking them off the ground as opposed to the [[aardvark]], which digs into the mound.&lt;ref name=br30/&gt; They locate their food by sound and also from the scent secreted by the soldier termites.&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt; An aardwolf may consume up to 250,000 [[termites]] per night using its long, sticky tongue.&lt;ref name=mh71/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wff&quot; /&gt;

They do not destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony, thus ensuring that the termites can rebuild and provide a continuous supply of food. They often memorize the location of such nests and return to them every few months.&lt;ref name=br31/&gt; During certain seasonal events, such as the onset of the rainy season and the cold of midwinter, the primary termites become scarce, so the need for other foods becomes pronounced. During these times, the southern aardwolf will seek out ''[[Hodotermes]] mossambicus'', a type of [[harvester termite]]&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt; active in the afternoon, which explains some of their diurnal behavior in the winter.&lt;ref name=mh71/&gt; The eastern aardwolf, during the rainy season, subsists on termites from the genera ''[[Odontotermes]]'' and ''[[Macrotermes]]''.&lt;ref name=mh71/&gt; They are also known to feed on other insects, larvae, eggs, and, some sources say, occasionally small mammals and birds, but these constitute a very small percentage of their total diet.&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt;

Unlike other [[hyena]]s, aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals.&lt;ref name=w1/&gt;&lt;ref name=br31/&gt; Contrary to popular myths, aardwolves do not eat carrion, and if they are seen eating while hunched over a dead carcass, they are actually eating larvae and beetles.&lt;ref name=w1/&gt; Also, contrary to some sources, they do not like meat, unless it is finely ground or cooked for them.&lt;ref name=w1/&gt; The adult aardwolf was formerly assumed to forage in small groups,&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; but more recent research has shown that they are primarily solitary foragers,&lt;ref name=koel/&gt; necessary because of the scarcity of their insect prey. Their primary source, ''Trinervitermes'', forages in small but dense patches of {{convert|25|-|100|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt; While foraging, the aardwolf can cover about {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} per hour, which translates to {{convert|8|-|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} per summer night and {{convert|3|-|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} per winter night.&lt;ref name=w1/&gt;

===Breeding===
The [[breeding season]] varies depending on location, but normally takes place during autumn or spring. In South Africa, breeding occurs in early July.&lt;ref name=mh108/&gt; During the breeding season, unpaired male aardwolves search their own territory, as well as others, for a female to mate with. Dominant males also mate opportunistically with the females of less dominant neighboring aardwolves,&lt;ref name=mh108/&gt; which can result in conflict between rival males.&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt; Dominant males even go a step further and as the breeding season approaches, they make increasingly greater and greater incursions onto weaker males' territories. As the female comes into [[oestrus]], they add pasting to their tricks inside of the other territories, sometimes doing so more in rivals' territories than their own.&lt;ref name=mh108/&gt; Females will also, when given the opportunity, mate with the dominant male, which increases the chances of the dominant male guarding &quot;his&quot; cubs with her.&lt;ref name=mh108/&gt; [[Copulation (zoology)|Copulation]] lasts between 1 and 4.5 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richardson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sliwa, Alexander. &quot;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander_Sliwa/publication/35640520_A_functional_analysis_of_scent_marking_and_mating_behaviour_in_the_aardwolf_Proteles_cristatus_Sparrman_1783/links/54edc8cd0cf272fc6d224e72.pdf A functional analysis of scent marking and mating behaviour in the aardwolf.]&quot; Proteles cristatus (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gestation]] lasts between 89 and 92 days,&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt;&lt;ref name=mh108/&gt; producing two to five [[List of animal names|cubs]] (most often two or three) during the rainy season (November–December),&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; when termites are more active.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; They are born with their eyes open, but initially are helpless,&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt; and weigh around {{convert|200|-|350|g|oz|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt; The first six to eight weeks are spent in the [[Burrow|den]] with their parents.&lt;ref name=br31/&gt; The male may spend up to six hours a night watching over the cubs while the mother is out looking for food.&lt;ref name=mh108/&gt;&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt; After three months, they begin supervised foraging, and by four months are normally independent, though they often share a den with their mother until the next breeding season.&lt;ref name=br31/&gt; By the time the next set of cubs is born, the older cubs have moved on.&lt;ref name=mh108/&gt; Aardwolves generally achieve [[sexual maturity]] at one and a half to two years of age.&lt;ref name=ingo/&gt;

==Conservation==
The aardwolf has not seen decreasing numbers and is relatively widespread throughout eastern Africa. They are not common throughout their range, as they maintain a density of no more than 1 per square kilometer, if food is abundant. Because of these factors, the IUCN has rated the aardwolf as [[least concern]].&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt; In some areas, they are persecuted because of the mistaken belief that they prey on livestock; however, they are actually beneficial to the farmers because they eat termites that are detrimental.&lt;ref name=PKR/&gt; In other areas, the farmers have recognized this, but they are still killed, on occasion, for their fur. Dogs and insecticides&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt; are also common killers of the aardwolf.&lt;ref name=br31/&gt;

===In captivity===

'''Adobe''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|d|oʊ|b|i|audio=En-us-adobe.ogg}} {{Respell|ə|DOH|bee}};&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|adobe, n.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-es|aˈðoβe|language}}) is a [[building material]] made from earth and organic materials. {{lang|es|Adobe}} is Spanish for ''[[mudbrick]]''. In some English-speaking regions of Spanish heritage, such as the [[Southwestern United States]], the term is used to refer to any kind of earthen construction, or various architectural styles like [[Pueblo Revival architecture|Pueblo Revival]] or [[Territorial Revival architecture|Territorial Revival]]. Most adobe buildings are similar in appearance to [[cob (material)|cob]] and [[rammed earth]] buildings. Adobe is among the earliest building materials, and is used throughout the world.

Adobe architecture has been dated to before 5,100 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mauricio|first=Ana Cecilia|last2=Grieseler|first2=Rolf|last3=Heller|first3=Andrew R.|last4=Kelley|first4=Alice R.|last5=Rumiche|first5=Francisco|last6=Sandweiss|first6=Daniel H.|last7=Viveen|first7=Willem|date=2021-11-30|title=The earliest adobe monumental architecture in the Americas|url=https://www.pnas.org/content/118/48/e2102941118|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=118|issue=48|doi=10.1073/pnas.2102941118|issn=0027-8424|pmid=34782482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Adobe bricks are rectangular prisms small enough that they can quickly air dry individually without cracking. They can be subsequently assembled, with the application of adobe mud to bond the individual bricks into a structure.  There is no standard size, with substantial variations over the years and in different regions. In some areas a popular size measured {{convert|8|×|4|×|12|in|cm}} weighing about {{convert|25|lb|kg}}; in other contexts the size is {{convert|10|×|4|×|14|in|cm}} weighing about {{convert|35|lb|kg}}. The maximum sizes can reach up to {{convert|100|lb|kg}}; above this weight it becomes difficult to move the pieces, and it is preferred to ram the mud ''[[in situ]]'', resulting in a different typology known as [[rammed earth]].

==Strength==
In dry climates, adobe structures are extremely durable, and account for some of the oldest existing buildings in the world. Adobe buildings offer significant advantages due to their greater [[thermal mass]], but they are known to be particularly susceptible to earthquake damage if they are not reinforced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingatlaschile.com/?s=adobe Short documentary about adobe preparation and 2010 Chile earthquake] Livingatlaschile.com, FICh.

==Etymology==
[[File:San Pedro de Atacama church.jpg|thumb|left|Church at [[San Pedro de Atacama]], Chile]]
The word ''adobe'' {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|d|oʊ|b|iː}} has existed for around 4000 years with relatively little change in either pronunciation or meaning. The word can be traced from the [[Middle Egyptian language|Middle Egyptian]] (c. 2000&amp;nbsp;BC) word ''[[wikt:ḏbt#Egyptian|ḏbt]]'' &quot;mud brick&quot; (with vowels unwritten). Middle Egyptian evolved into [[Late Egyptian language|Late Egyptian]], [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] or ''pre-Coptic'', and finally to Coptic (c. 600&amp;nbsp;BC), where it appeared as [[wikt:ⲧⲱⲃⲉ|ⲧⲱⲃⲉ]] ''tōbə''. This was adopted into Arabic as {{lang|ar|الطوب}} ''aṭ-ṭawbu'' or ''aṭ-ṭūbu'', with the [[Article (grammar)#Definite article|definite article]] ''al-'' attached.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;adobe&quot;, ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Second Edition, on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''tuba'',&lt;ref&gt;''Spanish Word Histories and Mysteries: English Words that Come from Spanish'', Houghton Mifflin Co., 2007, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earth-auroville.com/adobe_moulding_en.php &quot;Adobe Moulding&quot; Auroville Earth Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; This was assimilated into the [[Old Spanish language]] as ''adobe'' {{IPA|[aˈdobe]}}, probably via [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]]. English borrowed the word from Spanish in the early 18th century, still referring to [[mudbrick]] construction.

In more modern English usage, the term ''adobe'' has come to include a style of architecture popular in the desert climates of North America, especially in [[New Mexico]], regardless of the construction method.

==Composition==
[[File:Santa Fe adobe.jpg|thumb|Adobe style in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]]]
An adobe brick is a [[composite material]] made of earth mixed with water and an organic material such as [[straw]] or [[Dung (matter)|dung]]. The [[soil]] composition typically contains [[sand]], [[silt]] and [[clay]]. Straw is useful in binding the brick together and allowing the brick to dry evenly, thereby preventing cracking due to uneven shrinkage rates through the brick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vargas|first=J.|author2=J. Bariola|author3= M. Blondet|title=Seismic Strength of Adobe Masonry|journal=Materials and Structures|year=1986|volume=9|issue=4|pages=253–256|doi=10.1007/BF02472107|s2cid=108826268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dung offers the same advantage. The most desirable soil texture for producing the mud of adobe is 15% clay, 10–30% silt, and 55–75% fine sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garrison|first=James|title=Adobe-The Material, Its Deterioration, Its Coatings|url=http://missions.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/1%20Garrison-Adobe%20Characteristics.pdf|access-date=27 February 2013|pages=5–16|archive-date=5 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305165712/http://missions.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/1%20Garrison-Adobe%20Characteristics.pdf|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source quotes 15–25% clay and the remainder sand and coarser particles up to cobbles {{convert|2|to|10|in|mm|order=flip|-1|abbr=on}}, with no deleterious effect. Modern adobe is stabilized with either emulsified asphalt or Portland cement up to 10% by weight.

No more than half the clay content should be [[expansive clay]]s, with the remainder non-expansive illite or kaolinite. Too much expansive clay results in uneven drying through the brick, resulting in cracking, while too much kaolinite will make a weak brick. Typically the soils of the Southwest United States, where such construction has been widely used, are an adequate composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Austin |first=George |url=http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/publications/periodicals/nmg/downloads/6/n4/nmg_v6_n4_p69.pdf |work=New Mexico Geology, November 1984 |publisher=New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources |title=Adobe as a building material |url-status=dead |access-date=27 February 2013 |page=70 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232337/http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/publications/periodicals/nmg/downloads/6/n4/nmg_v6_n4_p69.pdf |archive-date=2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adobe walls are load bearing, i.e. they carry their own weight into the foundation rather than by another structure, hence the adobe must have sufficient compressive strength. In the United States, most building codes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quentinwilson.squarespace.com/storage/adobecode.pdf |title=14.7.4 NMAC |access-date=25 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818200926/http://quentinwilson.squarespace.com/storage/adobecode.pdf |archive-date=18 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; call for a minimum compressive strength of 300&amp;nbsp;lbf/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (2.07&amp;nbsp;newton/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for the adobe block. Adobe construction should be designed so as to avoid lateral structural loads that would cause bending loads. The building codes require the building sustain a 1 g lateral acceleration earthquake load. Such an acceleration will cause lateral loads on the walls, resulting in shear and bending and inducing tensile stresses. To withstand such loads, the codes typically call for a tensile modulus of rupture strength of at least 50&amp;nbsp;lbf/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.345&amp;nbsp;newton/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for the finished block.

In addition to being an inexpensive material with a small resource cost, adobe can serve as a significant heat reservoir due to the thermal properties inherent in the massive walls typical in adobe construction. In climates typified by hot days and cool nights, the high thermal mass of adobe mediates the high and low temperatures of the day, moderating the temperature of the living space. The massive walls require a large and relatively long input of heat from the sun ([[radiation]]) and from the surrounding air ([[convection]]) before they warm through to the interior. After the sun sets and the temperature drops, the warm wall will continue to transfer heat to the interior for several hours due to the time-lag effect. Thus, a well-planned adobe wall of the appropriate thickness is very effective at controlling inside temperature through the wide daily fluctuations typical of desert climates, a factor which has contributed to its longevity as a building material.

Thermodynamic material properties have significant variation in the literature. Some experiments suggest that the standard consideration of conductivity is not adequate for this material, as its main thermodynamic property is inertia, and conclude that experimental tests should be performed over a longer period of time than usual - preferably with changing thermal jumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michael, Philokyprou, Thravalou, Ioannou|year=2016|title=The role of adobes in the thermal performance of vernacular dwellings|url=https://craterre.hypotheses.org/files/2018/07/TERRA-2016_Th-4_Art-071_Michael_corr.pdf|journal=Terra Lyon 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an effective [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] for a north facing 10-in wall of R0=10 hr ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; °F/Btu,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenhomebuilding.com/QandA/adobe/mass.htm|title=Mass and insulation with adobe|access-date=12 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponds to thermal conductivity k=10 in x 1&amp;nbsp;ft/12 in /R0=0.33 Btu/(hr ft °F) or 0.57 W/(m K) in agreement with the thermal conductivity reported from another source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Experimental {{as written|Measu|rments [sic]}} of Thermal Properties for Mexican Building Materials to Simulate Thermal Behavior to Save Energy|last1=Chávez-Galán|first1=Jesus|last2=Almanza|first2=Rafael|last3=Rodríguez|first3=Neftali|publisher=Spriner|year=2008|isbn=978-3-540-75996-6|pages=496–501|chapter=Experimental {{as written|Measu|rments [sic]}} of Thermal Properties for Mexican Building Materials to Simulate Thermal Behavior to Save Energy|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-75997-3_89}}&lt;/ref&gt; To determine the total R-value of a wall, scale R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; by the thickness of the wall in inches.

==Uses==
===Poured and puddled adobe walls===
[[File:Cueva de las Jarillas.jpg|thumb|left|Cliff dwellings of poured or puddled adobe (cob) at [[Cuarenta Casas]] in Mexico]]
Poured and [[Puddling (engineering)|puddled]] adobe (puddled clay, piled earth), today called ''cob'', is made by placing soft adobe in layers, rather than by making individual dried bricks or using a form. &quot;Puddle&quot; is a general term for a clay or clay and sand-based material worked into a dense, plastic state.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;puddle, n. 4.&quot;. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' 2nd. ed. 2009. CD-rom.&lt;/ref&gt; These are the oldest methods of building with adobe in the Americas until holes in the ground were used as forms, and later wooden forms used to make individual bricks were introduced by the Spanish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keefe&quot;&gt;Keefe, Laurence (2005). ''Earth Building: Methods and Materials, Repair and Conservation''. London: Taylor &amp; Francis. p. 22. {{ISBN|978-0415323222}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adobe bricks===
[[File:Milyanfan-adobe-bricks-8038.jpg|thumb|Adobe bricks near a construction site in [[Milyanfan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]]]]
Bricks made from adobe are usually made by pressing the mud mixture into an open timber frame. In North America, the brick is typically about {{convert|25|by|36|cm|0|abbr=on}} in size. The mixture is molded into the frame, which is removed after initial setting. After drying for a few hours, the bricks are turned on edge to finish drying. Slow drying in shade reduces cracking.

The same mixture, without straw, is used to make [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and often [[plaster]] on interior and exterior walls. Some cultures used [[Lime (material)|lime]]-based cement for the plaster to protect against rain damage.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Depending on the form into which the mixture is pressed, adobe can encompass nearly any shape or size, provided drying is even and the mixture includes reinforcement for larger bricks. Reinforcement can include manure, straw, cement, [[rebar]], or wooden posts. Straw, cement, or manure added to a standard adobe mixture can produce a stronger, more crack-resistant brick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Technical Information Online |url=https://infohub.practicalaction.org/bitstream/handle/11283/314561/5110df27-5b44-4243-920e-37c50a310b36.pdf |title=Mud Plasters and Renders |publisher=Practicalaction.org |access-date=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A test is done on the soil content first. To do so, a sample of the soil is mixed into a clear container with some water, creating an almost completely saturated liquid. The container is shaken vigorously for one minute. It is then allowed to settle for a day until the soil has settled into layers. Heavier particles settle out first, sand above, silt above that, and very fine clay and organic matter will stay in suspension for days. After the water has cleared, percentages of the various particles can be determined. Fifty to 60 percent sand and 35 to 40 percent clay will yield strong bricks. The [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service]] at New Mexico State University recommends a mix of not more than {{frac|1|3}} clay, not less than {{frac|1|2}} sand, and never more than {{frac|1|3}} silt.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

During the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], designer and builder [[Hugh W. Comstock]] used cheaper materials and made a specialized adobe brick called &quot;Bitudobe.&quot; His first adobe house was built in 1936. In 1948, he published the book ''Post-Adobe; Simplified Adobe Construction Combining A Rugged Timber Frame And Modern Stabilized Adobe,'' which described his method of construction, including how to make &quot;Bitudobe.&quot; In 1938, he served as an adviser to the architects [[Ernest J. Kump|Franklin &amp; Kump]] Associates, who built the [[Carmel High School (Carmel, California)|Carmel High School]], which used his Post-adobe system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seavey&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Seavey |first=Kent |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Carmel/vsfoKsxi4q4C?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=Comstock|title=Carmel, A History in Architecture|work=Arcadia Pub. |place=Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|date=2007|page=114|access-date=2022-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/58880807 |title=Post-adobe; Simplified Adobe Construction Combining a Rugged Timber Frame and Modern Stabilized Adobe|last= Comstock |first= Hugh W.|date= 1948|access-date=2022-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adobe wall construction===
[[File:Fort Saint-Sébastien - Visite des fouilles juin 2012 68.jpg|thumb|The [[earthen plaster]] removed, exposing the adobe bricks at Fort St. Sebastien in France]]
The ground supporting an adobe structure should be compressed, as the weight of adobe wall is significant and foundation settling may cause cracking of the wall. Footing depth is to be below the ground frost level. The footing and stem wall are commonly 24 and 14 inches thick, respectively.  Modern construction codes call for the use of reinforcing steel in the footing and stem wall. Adobe bricks are laid by course. Adobe walls usually never rise above two stories as they are load bearing and adobe has low structural strength. When creating window and door openings, a [[lintel]] is placed on top of the opening to support the bricks above. Atop the last courses of brick, bond beams made of heavy wood beams or modern reinforced concrete are laid to provide a horizontal bearing plate for the roof beams and to redistribute lateral earthquake loads to shear walls more able to carry the forces. To protect the interior and exterior adobe walls, finishes such as mud plaster, whitewash or stucco can be applied. These protect the adobe wall from water damage, but need to be reapplied periodically. Alternatively, the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters that provide longer protection. Bricks made with stabilized adobe generally do not need protection of plasters.

===Adobe roof===
The traditional adobe roof has been constructed using a mixture of soil/clay, water, sand and organic materials. The mixture was then formed and pressed into wood forms, producing rows of dried earth bricks that would then be laid across a support structure of wood and plastered into place with more adobe.

Depending on the materials available, a roof may be assembled using wood or metal beams to create a framework to begin layering adobe bricks. Depending on the thickness of the adobe bricks, the framework has been preformed using a steel framing and a layering of a metal fencing or wiring over the framework to allow an even load as masses of adobe are spread across the metal fencing like cob and allowed to air dry accordingly. This method was demonstrated with an adobe blend heavily impregnated with cement to allow even drying and prevent cracking.

The more traditional flat adobe roofs are functional only in dry climates that are not exposed to snow loads. The heaviest wooden beams, called [[Viga (architecture)|vigas]], lie atop the wall. Across the vigas lie smaller members called latillas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dl-building.com/preservation-historic-adobe-buildings/ |title=Preservation of Historic Adobe Buildings |publisher=Dawson Lupul |access-date=30 January 2014 |archive-date=1 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701055819/http://dl-building.com/preservation-historic-adobe-buildings/ |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and upon those brush is then laid. Finally, the adobe layer is applied.

To construct a flat adobe roof, beams of wood were laid to span the building, the ends of which were attached to the tops of the walls. Once the vigas, latillas and brush are laid, adobe bricks are placed. An adobe roof is often laid with bricks slightly larger in width to ensure a greater expanse is covered when placing the bricks onto the roof. Following each individual brick should be a layer of adobe mortar, recommended to be at least {{convert|1|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} thick to make certain there is ample strength between the brick's edges and also to provide a relative moisture barrier during rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/construction/materials/adobe-construction2.htm|title=How Adobe Construction Works|date=2012-04-17|work=Add Water, Then Stir – How Adobe Construction Works {{!}} HowStuffWorks|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roof design evolved around 1850 in the American Southwest. Three inches of adobe mud was applied on top of the latillas, then 18 inches of dry adobe dirt applied to the roof. The dirt was contoured into a low slope to a downspout aka a 'canal'. When moisture was applied to the roof the clay particles expanded to create a waterproof membrane. Once a year it was necessary to pull the weeds from the roof and re-slope the dirt as needed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Depending on the materials, adobe roofs can be inherently fire-proof. The construction of a chimney can greatly influence the construction of the roof supports, creating an extra need for care in choosing the materials. The builders can make an adobe chimney by stacking simple adobe bricks in a similar fashion as the surrounding walls.

In 1927, the [[Uniform Building Code]] (UBC) was adopted in the United States. Local ordinances, referencing the UBC added requirements to building with adobe. These included: restriction of building height of adobe structures to 1-story, requirements for adobe mix (compressive and shear strength) and new requirements which stated that every building shall be designed to withstand seismic activity, specifically lateral forces. By the 1980s however, seismic related changes in the California Building Code effectively ended solid wall adobe construction in California; however Post-and-Beam adobe and veneers are still being used.

==Adobe around the world==
The largest structure ever made from adobe is the [[Arg-é Bam]] built by the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Other large adobe structures are the [[Huaca del Sol]] in Peru, with 100 million signed bricks and the ''ciudellas'' of [[Chan Chan]] and [[Tambo Colorado]], both in Peru.

[[File:Whitewater Rafting - geograph.org.uk - 1530594.jpg|thumb|[[River rafting]].]]
An '''adventure''' is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes [[risk]]y.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Adventure |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adventure |access-date=13 June 2013 |website=dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adventures may be activities with danger such as [[traveling]], [[exploring]], [[skydiving]], [[mountain climbing]], [[scuba diving]], [[river rafting]], or other [[extreme sports]]. Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological [[arousal]] or in order to achieve a greater goal such as the pursuit of [[knowledge]] that can only be obtained by such activities.

==Motivation==
Adventurous experiences create psychological [[arousal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gomà-i-Freixanet |first=M |title=On the psychobiology of personality |publisher=Elsevier |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-08-044209-9 |page=187 |chapter=Sensation Seeking and Participation in Physical Risk Sports |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YjcgAn8TfsC&amp;pg=PA187}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. [[fear]]) or positive (e.g. [[flow (psychology)|flow]]).  For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According to adventurer [[André Malraux]], in his ''La Condition Humaine'' (1933), &quot;If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?&quot;.

Similarly, [[Helen Keller]] stated that &quot;Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Keller |first=Helen |url=https://archive.org/details/opendoor00kell |title=The Open Door |publisher=Garden City, N.Y. Doubleday |year=1957 |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of [[recreation]] or [[wikt:excitement|excitement]]: examples are [[adventure racing]] and [[Adventure travel|adventure tourism]]. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers – the British adventurer [[Jason Lewis (adventurer)|Jason Lewis]], for example, uses adventures to draw global [[sustainability]] lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. [[Adventure education]] intentionally uses challenging experiences for [[learning]].

Author [[Jon Levy (behaviorist)|Jon Levy]] suggests that an experience should meet several criteria to be considered an adventure:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Snow |first=Shane |date=2 December 2016 |title=The Science of the Perfect Night Out |url=https://www.gq.com/story/science-of-the-best-night-ever |access-date=10 February 2019 |website=GQ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as [[Homer]]'s ''[[The Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Mansbach |first=Adam |date=12 February 2010 |title=Odysseus Remixed |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/books/review/Mansbach-t.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220101/https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/books/review/Mansbach-t.html |archive-date=2022-01-01 |url-access=limited}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Jenkyns |first=Richard |date=22 December 1996 |title=Heroic Enterprise – (Book review: The Odyssey translated by Robert Fagles) |work=nytimes.com |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/31/reviews/fagles-odyssey.html |access-date=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zweig |first=Paul |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/61858818 |title=The adventurer |date=1999 |publisher=Akadine Press |isbn=1-888173-72-6 |oclc=61858818 |author-link=Paul Zweig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[knight errant]] was the form the &quot;adventure seeker&quot; character took in the late Middle Ages.

The [[adventure novel]] exhibits these &quot;protagonist on adventurous journey&quot; characteristics as do many popular feature [[Adventure film|films]], such as ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |date=26 May 1977 |title=A Trip to a Far Galaxy That's Fun and Funny |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/26/archives/star-wars-a-trip-to-a-far-galaxy-thats-fun-and-funny.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |date=12 June 1981 |title=Movie Review: Raiders of the Lost Ark |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173AA42CA1494CC6B6799D836896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outdoors===
Adventure books may have the theme of the hero or main character going to face the [[wilderness]] or [[Mother Nature]]. Examples include books such as ''[[Hatchet (book)|Hatchet]]'' or ''[[My Side of the Mountain]]''. These books are less about &quot;questing&quot;, such as in mythology or other adventure novels, but more about surviving on their own, living off the land, gaining new experiences, and becoming closer to the natural world.

===Questing===
Many adventures are based on the idea of a quest: the hero goes off in pursuit of a reward, whether it be a skill, prize, treasure, or perhaps the safety of a person. On the way, the hero must overcome various obstacles to obtain their reward. 

===Video games===
{{See also|Adventure game}}

In [[video game culture|video-game culture]], an adventure game is a [[video game]] in which the player assumes the role of a protagonist in an interactive story driven by exploration and [[puzzle| puzzle-solving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Adams |first=Ernest |date=29 December 1999 |title=The Designer's Notebook: Three Problems for Interactive Storytellers |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3414/the_designers_notebook_three_.php |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510155724/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3414/the_designers_notebook_three_.php |archive-date=10 May 2010 |access-date=9 June 2010 |website=[[Gamasutra]] |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Video game genres|genre]]'s focus on story allows it to draw heavily from other [[narrative]]-based media, [[literature]] and [[film]], encompassing a wide variety of literary genres. Many adventure games ([[List of text-based computer games|text]] and [[List of graphic adventure games|graphic]]) are designed for a single player, since this emphasis on story and character makes multi-player design difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hitchens |first=Joe |title=Game Design Perspectives |publisher=Charles River Media |year=2002 |isbn=1584500905 |editor-last=Laramée |editor-first=François-Dominic |page=258 |chapter=Special Issues in Multi player Game Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nonfiction works==
From ancient times, travelers and explorers have written about their adventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2018-12-04|title=16 Famous Explorers and Their Incredible Stories|url=https://artoftravel.tips/famous-explorers-their-incredible-stories/|access-date=2021-12-19|website=The Art of Travel: Wander, Explore, Discover|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journals which became best-sellers in their day were written, such as [[Marco Polo]]'s journal ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'' or [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Roughing It]]''. Others were personal journals, only later published, such as the journals of [[Meriwether Lewis|Lewis]] and [[William Clark|Clark]] or [[Captain James Cook]]'s journals. There are also books written by those not directly a part of the adventure in question, such as ''[[The Right Stuff (book)|The Right Stuff]]'' by [[Tom Wolfe]] or books written by those participating in the adventure but in a format other than that of a journal, such as ''Conquistadors of the Useless'' by [[Lionel Terray]]. Documentaries often use the theme of adventure as well.

==Adventure sports ==

The '''aurochs''' ('''''Bos primigenius''''') ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔː|r|ɒ|k|s}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|aʊ|r|ɒ|k|s}}) is an [[extinct]] [[Bos|cattle]] species, considered to be the wild ancestor of modern domestic cattle. With a shoulder height of up to {{cvt|180|cm}} in bulls and {{cvt|155|cm}} in cows, it was one of the largest [[herbivore]]s in the [[Holocene]]; it had massive elongated and broad horns that reached {{cvt|80|cm}} in length.

The aurochs was part of the [[Pleistocene megafauna]]. It probably evolved in Asia and migrated west and north during warm [[interglacial]] periods. The oldest known aurochs [[fossil]]s found in [[India]] and [[North Africa]] date to the [[Middle Pleistocene]] and in Europe to the [[Holstein interglacial]]. As indicated by fossil remains in Northern Europe, it reached Denmark and southern Sweden during the [[Holocene]]. The aurochs declined during the late Holocene due to [[habitat loss]] and hunting, and became extinct when the last individual died in 1627 in [[Jaktorów]] forest in [[Poland]].

The aurochs is depicted in [[Paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s, [[Neolithic]] [[petroglyph]]s, [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[relief]]s and [[Bronze Age]] figurines. It symbolised power, sexual potency and prowess in [[religions of the ancient Near East]]. Its horns were used in [[votive offering]]s, as [[Trophy|trophies]] and [[drinking horn]]s.

Two aurochs [[domestication]] events occurred during the [[Neolithic Revolution]]. One gave rise to the domestic [[cattle]] (''Bos taurus'') in the [[Fertile Crescent]] in the [[Near East]] that was introduced to Europe via the [[Balkans]] and the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrid]]isation between aurochs and early domestic cattle occurred during the early Holocene. Domestication of the [[Indian aurochs]] led to the [[zebu]] cattle (''Bos indicus'') that hybridised with early taurine cattle in the [[Near East]] about 4,000 years ago. Some modern cattle breeds exhibit features reminiscent of the aurochs, such as the dark colour and light eel stripe along the back of bulls, the lighter colour of cows, or an aurochs-like horn shape.

== Etymology ==
Both &quot;aur&quot; and &quot;ur&quot; are [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] or [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] words meaning wild ox.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Partridge |first=E. |author-link=Eric Partridge |title=Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English |publisher=Greenwich House |year=1983 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-517-41425-5 |page=523 |chapter=Urus, Uri gallica |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/anetymologicald00valpgoog/page/523/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=C.

The [[scientific name]] ''Bos taurus'' was introduced by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758 for [[feral]] cattle in Poland.&lt;ref name=Linnaeus&gt;{{Cite book |author=Linnaeus, C. |title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae: secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis |location=Holmiae |publisher=Laurentii Salvii |date=1758 |page=71 |chapter=''Bos Taurus'' |language=la |volume=1 |edition=Tenth reformed |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/mobot31753000798865/page/70/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The scientific name ''Bos primigenius'' was proposed for the aurochs by [[Ludwig Heinrich Bojanus]] in 1827 who described the skeletal differences between the aurochs and domestic cattle.&lt;ref name=Bojanus1827&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bojanus, L.H. |year=1827 |title=De Uro nostrate eiusque sceleto commentation |journal=Nova Acta Physico-medica Academiae Caesareae Leopoldino-Carolinae Naturae Curiosum |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=53–478 |language=latin |url=https://archive.org/details/novaactaphysicom13218kais/page/444/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The name ''Bos namadicus'' was used by [[Hugh Falconer]] in 1859 for cattle [[fossil]]s found in [[Nerbudda]] [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Falconer, H. |year=1859 |title=Notice of the various species of bovine animals |journal=The Zoologist |volume=17 |pages=6414–6429 |url=https://archive.org/details/zoologistmonthly1718unse/page/6419/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Bos primigenius mauritanicus'' was coined by [[Philippe Thomas]] in 1881 who described fossils found in deposits near [[Oued Seguen]] west of [[Constantine, Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thomas, P. |year=1881 |title=Recherches sur les bovidés fossiles de l'Algérie |journal=Bulletin de la Société Zoologique de France |volume=6 |issue=Avril |pages=92–136 |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5442632q/f146.item}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] placed ''Bos primigenius'' on the ''Official List of [[Specific name (zoology)|Specific Names]] in Zoology'' and thereby recognized the [[Valid name (zoology)|validity]] of this name for a wild species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |year=2003 |title=Opinion 2027 (Case 3010).

According to a 16th century description by [[Sigismund von Herberstein]], the aurochs was pitch-black with a grey streak along the back; his wood carving made in 1556 was based on a culled aurochs, which he had received in [[Mazovia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Senglaub, K. |year=2002 |title=Sigmund von Herberstein (1486–1566) und die historischen Konfusionen um Ur und Wisent |journal=Säugetierkundliche Informationen |volume=5 |issue=26 |pages=253–266 |doi= |url=https://www.zobodat.at/biografien/Herberstein_Sigmund_von_Saeugetierkdl-Inf_26_0253-0266.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1827, [[Charles Hamilton Smith]] published an image of an aurochs that was based on an [[oil painting]] that he had purchased from a merchant in [[Augsburg]], which is thought to have been made in the early 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lydekker, R. |author-link=Richard Lydekker |year=1912 |location=London |publisher=Methuen &amp;Co.

=== Coat colour{{anchor|Coat colour}} ===
Remains of aurochs hair were not known until the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Ryder, M.L. |doi=10.1016/0305-4403(84)90045-1 |title=The first hair remains from an aurochs (''Bos primigenius'') and some medieval domestic cattle hair |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science |volume=11 |pages=99–101 |year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depictions show that the North African aurochs may have had a light saddle marking on its back.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frisch&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Der Auerochs: Das europäische Rind |first=W. |last=Frisch |year=2010 |isbn=978-3-00-026764-2 |publisher=Lipp Graphische Betriebe |place=Starnberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calves were probably born with a chestnut colour, and young bulls changed to black with a white [[eel stripe]] running down the spine, while cows retained a reddish-brown colour. Both sexes had a light-coloured muzzle, but evidence for variation in coat colour does not exist. Egyptian grave paintings show cattle with a reddish-brown coat colour in both sexes, with a light saddle, but the horn shape of these suggest that they may depict domesticated cattle.&lt;ref name=&quot;vVuure05&quot; /&gt; 
Many primitive cattle breeds, particularly those from Southern Europe, display similar coat colours to the aurochs, including the black colour in bulls with a light eel stripe, a pale mouth, and similar sexual dimorphism in colour.&lt;ref name=&quot;vVuure05&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Frisch&quot; /&gt; A feature often attributed to the aurochs is blond forehead hairs. According to historical descriptions of the aurochs, it had long and curly forehead hair, but none mentions a certain colour. Although the colour is present in a variety of primitive cattle breeds, it is probably a discolouration that appeared after domestication.&lt;ref name=&quot;vVuure05&quot; /&gt;

=== Body shape ===
{{multiple image |perrow=1 |image1=Aurochsfeatures.jpg |caption1=Drawing based on an aurochs bull skeleton from [[Lund]] and a cow skeleton from [[Cambridge]], with characteristic features of the aurochs |image2=Indian Aurochs B p namadicus 3.jpg |caption2=Speculative profile of an Indian aurochs}}
The proportions and body shape of the aurochs were strikingly different from many modern cattle breeds. For example, the legs were considerably longer and more slender, resulting in a shoulder height that nearly equalled the trunk length. The skull, carrying the large horns, was substantially larger and more elongated than in most cattle breeds. As in other wild bovines, the body shape of the aurochs was athletic, and especially in bulls, showed a strongly expressed neck and shoulder musculature. Therefore, the fore hand was larger than the rear, similar to the wisent, but unlike many domesticated cattle. Even in carrying cows, the udder was small and hardly visible from the side; this feature is equal to that of other wild bovines.&lt;ref name=&quot;vVuure05&quot; /&gt;

=== Size ===
The aurochs was one of the largest [[herbivore]]s in [[Holocene]] Europe. The size of an aurochs appears to have varied by region, with larger specimens in northern Europe than farther south. Aurochs in Denmark and Germany had an average height at the shoulders of {{cvt|155|-|180|cm}} in bulls and {{cvt|135|-|155|cm}} in cows, while aurochs bulls in [[Hungary]] reached {{cvt|160|cm}}.&lt;ref name=Kysely2008&gt;{{cite journal |title=Aurochs and potential crossbreeding with domestic cattle in Central Europe in the Eneolithic period.

The African aurochs was similar in size to the European aurochs in the Pleistocene, but declined in size during the transition to the Holocene; it may have also varied in size geographically.&lt;ref name=Linseele2004&gt;{{cite journal |author=Linseele, V. |year=2004 |title=Size and size change of the African aurochs during the Pleistocene and Holocene |journal=Journal of African Archaeology |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=165–185 |doi=10.3213/1612-1651-10026 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269674903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body mass of aurochs appears to have shown some variability. Some individuals reached around {{cvt|700|kg|-1}}, whereas those from the late Middle Pleistocene are estimated to have weighed up to {{cvt|1500|kg|-1}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;vVuure05&quot; /&gt; The aurochs exhibited considerable [[sexual dimorphism]] in the size of males and females.&lt;ref name=vuure&gt;{{cite journal |last=Van Vuure |first=T. |date=2002 |title=History, morphology and ecology of the Aurochs (''Bos primigenius'') |journal=Lutra |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |citeseerx=10.1.1.534.6285 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=C34E254DA21CDD676ED30B5943B72479?doi=10.1.1.534.6285&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Horns ===
The horns were massive, reaching {{cvt|80|cm}} in length and between {{cvt|10|and|20|cm}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frisch&quot; /&gt; Its horns grew from the skull at a 60° angle to the muzzle facing forwards and were curved in three directions, namely upwards and outwards at the base, then swinging forwards and inwards, then inwards and upwards. The curvature of bull horns was more strongly expressed than horns of cows.&lt;ref name=&quot;vVuure05&quot; /&gt; The basal circumference of [[horn core]]s reached {{cvt|44.5|cm}} in the largest Chinese specimen and {{cvt|48|cm}} in a French specimen.&lt;ref name=zongg/&gt; Some cattle breeds still show horn shapes similar to that of the aurochs, such as the Spanish fighting bull, and occasionally also individuals of derived breeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;vVuure05&quot; /&gt;

In Denmark, the first known local extinction of the aurochs occurred after the [[sea level rise]] on the newly formed [[Danish islands]] about 8,000–7,500 years BP, and the last documented aurochs lived in southern [[Jutland]] around 3,000 years BP.&lt;ref name=Gravlund_al2012/&gt;

The last known aurochs herd lived in a [[marsh]]y woodland in Poland's [[Jaktorów]] Forest. It decreased from around 50 individuals in the mid 16th century to four individuals by 1601.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
Aurochs formed small herds mainly in winter, but lived singly or in smaller groups during the summer.&lt;ref name=Geptner1961/&gt; If aurochs had social behaviour similar to their descendants, social status was gained through displays and fights, in which both cows and bulls engaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frisch&quot; /&gt; 
With its [[hypsodont]] jaw, the aurochs was probably a grazer, with a food selection very similar to domesticated cattle&lt;ref name=&quot;vVuure05&quot; /&gt; feeding on grass, twigs and [[acorn]]s.&lt;ref name=Geptner1961/&gt;

[[Mating]] season was in September, and calves were born in spring.&lt;ref name=Geptner1961/&gt; The bulls had severe fights, and evidence from the Jaktorów forest shows these could lead to death. In autumn, aurochs fed up for the winter, and got fatter and shinier than during the rest of the year. Calves stayed with their mother until they were strong enough to join and keep up with the herd on the feeding grounds. They were vulnerable to predation by [[grey wolf]] (''Canis lupus''), [[brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos''), while healthy adult aurochs probably did not have to fear predators. The [[lion]] (''Panthera leo''), [[tiger]] (''Panthera tigris'') and [[hyena]] (''Crocuta crocuta'') were likely predators in prehistoric times. According to historical descriptions, the aurochs was swift and could be very aggressive, but not afraid of humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;vVuure05&quot;/&gt;

Aurochs were hunted with arrows, nets and hunting dogs, and its hair on the forehead was cut from the living animal; belts were made out of this hair and believed to increase the [[fertility]] of women. When the aurochs was slaughtered, the ''[[Cardiac skeleton#Os cordis|os cordis]]'' was extracted from the heart; this bone contributed to the mystique and magical powers that were attributed to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;vVuure05&quot; /&gt;

== Domestication ==
The earliest known [[domestication]] of the aurochs dates to the [[Neolithic Revolution]] in the [[Fertile Crescent]], where cattle hunted and kept by Neolithic farmers gradually decreased in size between 9800 and 7500 BC. Aurochs bones found at [[Mureybet]] and [[Göbekli Tepe]] are larger in size than cattle bones from later Neolithic settlements in northern [[Syria]] like [[Dja'de el-Mughara]] and [[Tell Halula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Helmer, D. |name-list-style=amp |author2=Gourichon, L. |author3=Monchot, H. |author4=Peters, J. |author5=Segui, M.S. |year=2005 |title=The first steps of animal domestication: new archeological approaches |chapter=Identifying early domestic cattle from pre-pottery Neolithic sites on the Middle Euphrates using sexual dimorphism |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxbow Books |isbn=1-84217-121-6 |editor1=Vigne, J.D. |editor2=Peters, J. |editor3=Helmer, D. |pages=86–95 |chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235341120}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Late Neolithic]] sites of northern [[Iraq]] and western [[Iran]] dating to the sixth millennium BC, cattle remains are also smaller but more frequent, indicating that domesticated cattle were imported during the [[Halaf culture]] from the central Fertile Crescent region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Arbuckle, B.S. |name-list-style=amp |author2=Price, M.D. |author3=Hongo, H. |author4=Öksüz, B. |year=2016 |title=Documenting the initial appearance of domestic cattle in the Eastern Fertile Crescent (northern Iraq and western Iran) |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science |volume=72 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.1016/j.jas.2016.05.008 |url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/maxprice/files/arbuckle_2016_cattle.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Breeding of aurochs-like cattle ==
{{multiple image |perrow=1 |image1=Hausrindlainz.jpg |caption1=Heck cattle in [[Lainzer Tiergarten]]}}

Starting in 1996, Heck cattle were crossed with southern European cattle breeds such as [[Sayaguesa Cattle]], [[Chianina]] and to a lesser extent [[Spanish Fighting Bull]]s in the hope of creating a more aurochs-like animal. The resulting crossbreeds are called [[Taurus Project|Taurus cattle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bunzel-Drüke, M. |year=2001 |title=Ecological substitutes for Wild Horse (''Equus ferus'', Boddaert 1785 = ''E. przewalskii'', Poljakov 1881) and Aurochs (''Bos primigenius'', Bojanus 1827) |journal=Natur- und Kulturlandschaft |volume=4 |pages=240–252 |citeseerx=10.1.1.403.8349 |url=https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.403.8349&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other breeding-back projects are the [[Tauros Programme]] and the [[Uruz Project]].&lt;ref name=Lorimer2/&gt;

'''Bears''' are [[carnivora]]n [[mammal]]s of the [[family (biology)|family]] '''Ursidae'''. They are classified as [[caniforms]], or doglike carnivorans.  Although only eight [[species]] of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of [[habitat]]s throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, [[plantigrade]] paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.

While the [[polar bear]] is mostly [[carnivorous]], and the [[giant panda]] feeds almost entirely on [[bamboo]], the remaining six species are [[omnivorous]] with varied diets. With the exception of [[courting]] individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically [[solitary animals]]. They may be [[diurnality|diurnal]] or [[nocturnal]] and have an excellent [[sense of smell]]. Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers.  Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of [[hibernation]], up to 100 days.

Bears have been hunted since [[prehistoric]] times for [[bear meat|their meat]] and fur; they have been used for [[bear-baiting]] and other forms of entertainment, such as being [[tame bear|made to dance]]. With their powerful physical presence, they play a prominent role in [[the arts]], [[mythology]], and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian [[bile bear]] market. The [[IUCN]] lists six bear species as [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] or [[endangered species|endangered]], and even [[least concern]] species, such as the [[brown bear]], are at risk of [[extirpation]] in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;bear&quot; comes from [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|bera}}'' and belongs to a family of names for the bear in [[Germanic languages]], such as Swedish ''{{lang|sv|[[bjorn|björn]]}}'', also used as a first name. This form is conventionally said to be related to a [[Proto-Indo-European]] word for &quot;brown&quot;, so that &quot;bear&quot; would mean &quot;the brown one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iNUSDAAAQBAJ&amp;q=indo%20european&amp;pg=PA333|title=The Oxford Iintroduction to Proto Indo European and the Proto Indo European World|last1=Mallory|first1=J.

{{Further information|List of ursids}}
The family Ursidae is one of nine families in the suborder [[Caniformia]], or &quot;doglike&quot; carnivorans, within the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Carnivora]]. Bears' closest living relatives are the [[pinniped]]s, [[Canidae|canids]], and [[musteloidea|musteloid]]s.&lt;ref name=Hunt2005&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wesley-Hunt, G.D. |author2=Flynn, J.J. |year=2005 |title=Phylogeny of the Carnivora: Basal relationships among the Carnivoramorphans, and assessment of the position of 'Miacoidea' relative to Carnivora |journal=Journal of Systematic Palaeontology |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–28 |doi=10.1017/S1477201904001518|s2cid=86755875 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies: [[Ailuropodinae]] (monotypic with the [[giant panda]]), [[Tremarctinae]] (monotypic with the [[spectacled bear]]), and [[Ursinae]] (containing six species divided into one to three genera, depending on the authority). Nuclear chromosome analysis show that the [[karyotype]] of the six ursine bears is nearly identical, each having 74&amp;nbsp;[[chromosome]]s (''see'' [[Ursid hybrid]]), whereas the giant panda has 42&amp;nbsp;chromosomes and the spectacled bear 52. These smaller numbers can be explained by the fusing of some chromosomes, and the banding patterns on these match those of the ursine species, but differ from those of procyonids, which supports the inclusion of these two species in Ursidae rather than in [[Procyonidae]], where they had been placed by some earlier authorities.&lt;ref name=Servheen1999&gt;{{cite book |author1=Servheen, C. |author2=Herrero, S. |author3=Peyton, B. |title=Bears: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/1999-004.pdf |year=1999 |publisher=IUCN |isbn=978-2-8317-0462-3 |pages=26–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest members of Ursidae belong to the extinct subfamily Amphicynodontinae, including ''[[Parictis]]'' (late [[Eocene]] to early middle [[Miocene]], 38–18&amp;nbsp;[[Mya (unit)|Mya]]) and the slightly younger ''Allocyon'' (early [[Oligocene]], 34–30&amp;nbsp;Mya), both from North America.

The subfamily Ursinae experienced a dramatic proliferation of taxa about 5.3–4.5&amp;nbsp;Mya, coincident with major environmental changes; the first members of the genus ''[[Ursus (genus)|Ursus]]'' appeared around this time. The [[sloth bear]] is a modern survivor of one of the earliest lineages to diverge during this radiation event (5.3&amp;nbsp;Mya); it took on its peculiar morphology, related to its diet of termites and ants, no later than by the early Pleistocene. By 3–4&amp;nbsp;Mya, the species ''Ursus minimus'' appears in the fossil record of Europe; apart from its size, it was nearly identical to today's [[Asian black bear]]. It is likely ancestral to all bears within Ursinae, perhaps aside from the sloth bear. Two lineages evolved from ''U.&amp;nbsp;minimus'': the black bears (including the [[sun bear]], the Asian black bear, and the [[American black bear]]); and the brown bears (which includes the [[polar bear]]).

There are two phylogenetic hypotheses on the relationships among extant and fossil bear species.

The second alternative phylogenetic hypothesis was implemented by McKenna et al.

===Morphology===
[[File:Bear foot.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Unlike most other [[carnivora]]ns, bears have [[plantigrade]] feet. Drawing by [[Richard Owen]], 1866.]]

Bears are generally bulky and robust animals with short tails. They are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] with regard to size, with males typically being larger.&lt;ref name=Derocheretal86&gt;{{cite journal |last=Derocher |first=Andrew E. |author2=Andersen, Magnus |author3=Wiig, Øystein |title=Sexual dimorphism of polar bears |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |year=2005 |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=895–901 |doi=10.1644/1545-1542(2005)86[895:SDOPB]2.0.CO;2 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hunt98&gt;{{Cite book |author=Hunt, R. M. Jr. |year=1998 |chapter=Ursidae |editor1=Janis, Christine M. |editor2=Scott, Kathleen M. |editor3=Jacobs, Louis L. |title=Evolution of Tertiary Mammals of North America, volume 1: Terrestrial carnivores, ungulates, and ungulatelike mammals |location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=174–195 |isbn=978-0-521-35519-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species.&lt;ref name=Hunt98/&gt; Relying as they do on strength rather than speed, bears have relatively short limbs with thick bones to support their bulk. The [[Scapula|shoulder blades]] and the [[pelvis]] are correspondingly massive. The limbs are much straighter than those of the [[big cat]]s as there is no need for them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their gait. The strong forelimbs are used to catch prey, to excavate dens, to dig out burrowing animals, to turn over rocks and logs to locate prey, and to club large creatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall Cavendish&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Black bear large.jpg|thumb|upright|Despite being [[quadruped]]s, bears can stand and sit as humans do, as demonstrated by this [[American black bear]].]]
Unlike most other land carnivorans, bears are [[plantigrade]]. They distribute their weight toward the hind feet, which makes them look lumbering when they walk. They are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire, and as a result mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. Bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance. Their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. Bears' non-retractable claws are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. The claws on the front feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees; black bears are the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest claws. Pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front feet which acts as a thumb, and is used for gripping [[bamboo]] shoots as the animals feed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall Cavendish&quot;/&gt;

Most mammals have [[Agouti (coloration)|agouti]] hair, with each individual hair shaft having bands of color corresponding to two different types of [[melanin]] pigment. Bears however have a single type of melanin and the hairs have a single color throughout their length, apart from the tip which is sometimes a different shade. The coat consists of long guard hairs, which form a protective shaggy covering, and short dense hairs which form an insulating layer trapping air close to the skin. The shaggy coat helps maintain body heat during winter hibernation and is shed in the spring leaving a shorter summer coat. Polar bears have hollow, translucent guard hairs which gain heat from the sun and conduct it to the dark-colored skin below. They have a thick layer of blubber for extra insulation, and the soles of their feet have a dense pad of fur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall Cavendish&quot;/&gt; While bears tend to be uniform in color, some species may have markings on the chest or face and the giant panda has a bold black-and-white pelage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward124&quot;/&gt;

Bears have small rounded ears so as to minimize heat loss, but neither their hearing or sight are particularly acute. Unlike many other carnivorans they have [[color vision]], perhaps to help them distinguish ripe nuts and fruits. They are unique among carnivorans in not having touch-sensitive [[whiskers]] on the muzzle; however, they have an excellent [[olfaction|sense of smell]], better than that of the dog, or possibly any other mammal. They use smell for signalling to each other (either to warn off rivals or detect mates) and for finding food. Smell is the principal sense used by bears to locate most of their food, and they have excellent memories which helps them to relocate places where they have found food before.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall Cavendish&quot;/&gt;

The [[skull]]s of bears are massive, providing anchorage for the powerful [[Masseter muscle|masseter]] and [[temporal muscle|temporal]] jaw muscles. The [[canine tooth|canine teeth]] are large but mostly used for display, and the [[molar (tooth)|molar]] teeth flat and crushing.

[[File:Bear tracks (5062843250).jpg|thumb|right|[[American black bear]] tracks at [[Superior National Forest]], [[Minnesota]], U.S.]]

===Feeding===
[[File:Giant Panda Tai Shan.JPG|thumb|left|[[Giant panda]] feeding on [[bamboo]] at [[Smithsonian National Zoological Park]], [[Washington, D. C.]] This species is almost entirely [[herbivorous]].]]

Most bears are opportunistic [[omnivore]]s and consume more plant than animal matter, and appears to have evolved from an ancestor which was a low-protein macronutrient omnivore.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-19742-z Ursids evolved early and continuously to be low-protein macronutrient omnivores]&lt;/ref&gt; They eat anything from leaves, roots, and [[berries]] to [[insect]]s, [[carrion]], fresh meat, and fish, and have digestive systems and teeth adapted to such a diet.&lt;ref name=&quot;ServheenForeword&quot;/&gt; At the extremes are the almost entirely herbivorous giant panda and the mostly carnivorous polar bear. However, all bears feed on any food source that becomes seasonally available.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward83&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ward|Kynaston|1995|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Asiatic black bears in [[Taiwan]] consume large numbers of [[acorn]]s when these are most common, and switch to [[ungulate]]s at other times of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;asiablackdiet&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hwang |first=Mei-Hsiu |year=2002 |title=Diets of Asiatic black bears in Taiwan, with Methodological and Geographical Comparisons |url=http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_13/Hwang_13.pdf |journal=Ursus |volume=13 |pages=111–125 |access-date=2012-12-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723060824/http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_13/Hwang_13.pdf |archive-date=2013-07-23 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
[[File:Ursus thibetanus 01.JPG|thumb|left|[[Captive animal|Captive]] [[Asian black bear]]s during an aggressive encounter]]

Bears produce a number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, grunting or chuffing many be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, snorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed. Barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters.

Bears sometimes communicate with visual displays such as [[bipedalism|standing upright]], which exaggerates the individual's size. The chest markings of some species may add to this intimidating display. Staring is an aggressive act and the facial markings of spectacled bears and giant pandas may help draw attention to the eyes during [[Agonistic behavior|agonistic]] encounters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward124&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ward|Kynaston|1995|pp=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals may approach each other by stiff-legged walking with the head lowered. Dominance between bears is asserted by making a frontal orientation, showing the [[canine teeth]], muzzle twisting and neck stretching.  A subordinate may respond with a lateral orientation, by turning away and dropping the head and by sitting or lying down.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stonorov&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Stonorov, D. |author2=Stokes, A.

===Reproduction and development{{anchor|Breeding}}===
[[File:Black Bears mating.jpg|thumb|left|American black bears mating at the [[North American Bear Center]]]]

The mating system of bears has variously been described as a form of [[Polygyny in animals|polygyny]], [[promiscuity]] and [[serial monogamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Eide, S. |author2=Miller, S. |title=Brown Bear |publisher=Alaska Department of Fish and Game |url=https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/education/wns/brown_bear.pdf |access-date=14 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303124834/http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/education/wns/brown_bear.pdf |archive-date=2013-03-03 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward138&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ward|Kynaston|1995|pp=138–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mammalian&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lariviere, S. |year=2001 |title=Ursus americanus |journal=Mammalian Species |issue=647 |pages=1–11 |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/647_Ursus_americanus.pdf |doi=10.1644/1545-1410(2001)647&lt;0001:ua&gt;2.0.co;2 |s2cid=198968922 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316025524/http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/647_Ursus_americanus.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the breeding season, males take notice of females in their vicinity and females become more tolerant of males. A male bear may visit a female continuously over a period of several days or weeks, depending on the species, to test her reproductive state. During this time period, males try to prevent rivals from interacting with their mate. Courtship may be brief, although in some Asian species, courting pairs may engage in wrestling, hugging, mock fighting and vocalizing. [[Induced ovulation (animals)|Ovulation is induced by mating]], which can last up to 30 minutes depending on the species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward138&quot;/&gt;

Cubs are born blind and helpless with at most a thin layer of hair, relying on their mother for warmth. The milk of the female bear is rich in fat and antibodies and cubs may suckle for up to a year after they are born. By 2–3 months, cubs can follow their mother outside the den.

{{See also|Bear in heraldry}}

Bears have been popular subjects in art, literature, folklore and mythology. The image of the mother bear was prevalent throughout societies in North America and Eurasia, based on the female's devotion and protection of her cubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ward|Kynaston|1995|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures, the bear is a symbol of rebirth because of its hibernation and re-emergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ward|Kynaston|1995|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A widespread belief among cultures of North America and northern Asia associated bears with [[shaman]]; this may be based on the solitary nature of both. Bears have thus been thought to predict the future and shaman were believed to have been capable of transforming into bears.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ward|Kynaston|1995|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''bald eagle''' ('''''Haliaeetus leucocephalus''''') is a [[bird of prey]] found in North America. A [[sea eagle]], it has two known [[subspecies]] and forms a [[Species complex|species pair]] with the [[white-tailed eagle]] (''Haliaeetus albicilla''), which occupies the same niche as the bald eagle in the [[Palearctic realm|Palearctic]]. Its range includes most of [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]], all of the [[contiguous United States]], and northern [[Mexico]]. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.

The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on [[fish]], which it swoops down upon and snatches from the water with its talons. It builds the largest [[bird nest|nest]] of any North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to {{convert|4|m|ft|sp=us|abbr = on}} deep, {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sp=us|abbr = on}} wide, and {{convert|1|t|ST|lk = on|sp = us}} in weight. [[Sexual maturity]] is attained at the age of four to five years.

Bald eagles are not actually [[bald]]; the name derives from an older meaning of the word, &quot;white headed&quot;. The adult is mainly brown with a white head and tail. The sexes are identical in [[plumage]], but females are about 25 percent larger than males. The yellow [[beak]] is large and hooked. The plumage of the immature is brown.

The bald eagle is the [[List of national birds|national bird]] of the [[United States|United States of America]] and appears on its [[Great Seal of the United States|seal]]. In the late 20th century it was on the brink of [[local extinction|extirpation]] in the contiguous United States. Populations have since recovered, and the species was removed from the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]]'s list of [[endangered species]] on July 12, 1995, and transferred to the list of [[threatened species]]. It was removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous states]] on June 28, 2007.

==Taxonomy==
The bald eagle is placed in the genus ''Haliaeetus'' ([[sea eagle]]s), and gets both its common and specific scientific names from the distinctive appearance of the adult's head. ''Bald'' in the English name is from the older usage meaning &quot;white&quot; rather than &quot;hairless&quot;, referring to the white head and tail feathers and their contrast with the darker body, as in ''[[piebald]]''.&lt;ref name=b7/&gt; The genus name is [[New Latin]]: ''Haliaeetus'' (from the {{lang-grc|ἁλιάετος|haliaetos|sea eagle}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a(lia/etos|ἁλιάετος|longref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the specific name, ''leucocephalus'', is Latinized ({{lang-grc|λευκός|leukos|white}})&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|leuko/s2|λευκός|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ({{lang-grc|κεφαλή|kephalḗ|head|label=none}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|kefalh/|κεφαλή|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Georgia&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Bald Eagle flying over ice (Southern Ontario, Canada).jpg|thumb|Bald eagle anatomy]]
The bald eagle was one of the many species originally described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his 18th-century work ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', under the name ''Falco leucocephalus''.&lt;ref name=b3/&gt;

There are two recognized [[subspecies]] of bald eagle:&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ITIS&quot;/&gt;
* ''H. l. leucocephalus'' &lt;small&gt;(Linnaeus, 1766)&lt;/small&gt; is the nominate subspecies. It is found in the southern United States and [[Baja California Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ESRP&quot;/&gt;
* ''H. l. washingtoniensis'' &lt;small&gt;(Audubon, 1827)&lt;/small&gt;, synonym ''H. l. alascanus'' Townsend, 1897, the northern subspecies, is larger than southern nominate ''leucocephalus''. It is found in the northern United States, Canada and Alaska.&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ESRP&quot;/&gt;

The bald eagle forms a [[species pair]] with the [[white-tailed eagle]] of [[Eurasia]]. This species pair consists of a white-headed and a tan-headed species of roughly equal size; the white-tailed eagle also has overall somewhat paler brown body plumage. The two species fill the same [[ecological niche]] in their respective ranges. The pair diverged from other sea eagles at the beginning of the Early [[Miocene]] (c. 10&amp;nbsp;[[Ma (unit)|Ma BP]]) at the latest, but possibly as early as the Early/Middle [[Oligocene]], 28 Ma BP, if the most ancient fossil record is correctly assigned to this [[genus]].&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;

==Description==
The [[plumage]] of an adult bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but [[sexual dimorphism]] is evident in the species, in that females are 25% larger than males.&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt; The beak, feet and [[iris (anatomy)|irises]] are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt; The [[beak]] is large and hooked, with a yellow [[cere]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornell&quot;/&gt; The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related [[African fish eagle]] (''Haliaeetus vocifer'') (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body (albeit of somewhat more rufous hue), white head and tail, but differs from the bald eagle in having a white chest and black tip to the bill.&lt;ref name= Ferguson-Lees/&gt;

[[File:Bald Eagle Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Head details]]
The plumage of the immature is a dark brown overlaid with messy white streaking until the fifth (rarely fourth, very rarely third) year, when it reaches sexual maturity.&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt; Immature bald eagles are distinguishable from the [[golden eagle]] (''Aquila chrysaetos''), the only other very large, non-vulturine raptorial bird in North America, in that the former has a larger, more protruding head with a larger [[beak]], straighter edged wings which are held flat (not slightly raised) and with a stiffer wing beat and feathers which do not completely cover the legs. When seen well, the golden eagle is distinctive in plumage with a more solid warm brown color than an immature bald eagle, with a reddish-golden patch to its [[nape]] and (in immature birds) a highly contrasting set of white squares on the wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;sibley&quot;/&gt;

The bald eagle has sometimes been considered the largest true raptor ([[Accipitriformes|accipitrid]]) in North America. The only larger species of raptor-like bird is the [[California condor]] (''Gymnogyps californianus''), a [[New World vulture]] which today is not generally considered a taxonomic ally of true accipitrids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt; However, the [[golden eagle]], averaging {{convert|4.18|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and {{convert|63|cm|in|abbr=on}} in [[Wing chord (biology)|wing chord length]] in its American race (''Aquila chrysaetos canadensis''), is merely {{convert|455|g|lb|abbr=on}} lighter in mean body mass and exceeds the bald eagle in mean wing chord length by around {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name= Ferguson-Lees/&gt;&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt; Additionally, the bald eagle's close cousins, the relatively longer-winged but shorter-tailed [[white-tailed eagle]] and the overall larger [[Steller's sea eagle]] (''Haliaeetus pelagicus''), may, rarely, wander to coastal Alaska from Asia.&lt;ref name= Ferguson-Lees/&gt;

[[File:Bald Eagle, wings and tail feathers.jpg|thumb|A bald eagle showing its wingspan]]
The bald eagle has a body length of {{convert|70|–|102|cm|in|sp=us|abbr = on}}. Typical wingspan is between {{convert|1.8|and|2.3|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}} and mass is normally between {{convert|3|and|6.3|kg|lb|sp=us|abbr = on}}.&lt;ref name= Ferguson-Lees/&gt; Females are about 25% larger than males, averaging as much as {{convert|5.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and against the males' average weight of {{convert|4.1|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt;&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=b2/&gt;

The size of the bird varies by location and generally corresponds with [[Bergmann's rule]]: the species increases in size further away from the equator and the tropics. For example, eagles from [[South Carolina]] average {{convert|3.27|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in mass and {{convert|1.88|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}} in wingspan, smaller than their northern counterparts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy&quot;/&gt; One field guide in Florida listed similarly small sizes for bald eagles there, at about {{convert|4.13|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Maehr |first1=D. S. |last2=Kale |first2=H. W. |year=2005 |title=Florida's Birds: A Field Guide and Reference |publisher=Pineapple Press Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of intermediate size, 117 migrant bald eagles in [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] were found to average {{convert|4.22|kg|lb|abbr=on}} but this was mostly (possibly post-dispersal) juvenile eagles, with 6 adults here averaging {{convert|4.3|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Patterson |first1=D.A. |last2=McClelland |first2=B.R. |last3=Shea |first3=D.S. |last4=McClelland |first4=P.T. |year=1998 |title=Size Variation of Migrant Bald Eagles at Glacier National Park, Montana |journal=J. Raptor Res. |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=120–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wintering eagles in Arizona (winter weights are usually the highest of the year since, like many raptors, they spend the highest percentage of time foraging during winter) were found to average {{convert|4.74|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zylo |first1=M. T. |year=2012 |title=Bald eagles (''Haliaeetus leucocephalus'') wintering in northern Arizona select perches based on food availability, visibility and cover |journal=Doctoral Dissertation |publisher=Northern Arizona University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest eagles are from [[Alaska]], where large females may weigh more than {{convert|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and span {{convert|2.44|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}} across the wings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornell&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; A survey of adult weights in Alaska showed that females there weighed on average {{convert|5.35|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, respectively, and males weighed {{convert|4.23|kg|lb|abbr=on}} against immatures which averaged {{convert|5.09|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4.05|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in the two sexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Eagles, Hawks and Falcons of the World |first1=Leslie |last1=Brown |first2=Dean |last2=Amadon |author-link2=Dean Amadon |publisher=The Wellfleet Press |year=1986 |isbn=978-1-55521-472-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Palmer&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Palmer |editor-first1=R.

The call consists of weak staccato, chirping whistles, ''kleek kik ik ik ik'', somewhat similar in cadence to a [[gull]]'s call. The calls of young birds tend to be more harsh and shrill than those of adults.&lt;ref name= Ferguson-Lees/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sibley&quot;/&gt;

==Range==
[[File:Bald-Eagle-9114-cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Bald eagle in flight at Yellowstone National Park, [[Wyoming]]]]
The bald eagle's natural range covers most of North America, including most of Canada, all of the [[continental United States]], and northern Mexico. It is the only [[sea eagle]] [[endemism|endemic]] to North America. Occupying varied habitats from the [[bayou]]s of [[Louisiana]] to the [[Sonoran Desert]] and the eastern deciduous forests of [[Quebec]] and [[New England]], northern birds are [[bird migration|migratory]], while southern birds are resident, remaining on their breeding territory all year. At minimum population, in the 1950s, it was largely restricted to [[Alaska]], the [[Aleutian Islands]], northern and eastern Canada, and Florida.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bull87&quot;/&gt; From 1966 to 2015 bald eagle numbers increased substantially throughout its winter and breeding ranges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBS Trend Maps – Bald eagle ''Haliaeetus leucocephalus'' |url=https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/tr2015/trend2015_v3.html|publisher=Patuxent Wildlife Research Center|access-date=December 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2018 the species nests in every continental state and province in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot;/&gt;

The majority of bald eagles in Canada are found along the [[British Columbia]] coast while large populations are found in the forests of [[Alberta]], Saskatchewan, [[Manitoba]] and [[Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.canadiangeographic.ca/article/animal-facts-bald-eagle |title=Animal Facts: Bald Eagle |date=August 14, 2006 |access-date=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bald eagles also congregate in certain locations in winter. From November until February, one to two thousand birds winter in [[Squamish, British Columbia]], about halfway between [[Vancouver]] and [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]]. The birds primarily gather along the [[Squamish River|Squamish]] and [[Cheakamus River|Cheakamus]] Rivers, attracted by the [[salmon]] spawning in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baldeagleinfo.com/eagle/eagle1.html |title=Bald Eagle Viewing Directory |access-date=August 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar congregations of wintering bald eagles at open lakes and rivers, wherein fish are readily available for hunting or scavenging, are observed in the northern United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making their comeback|url=http://www.oswegocountynewsnow.com/news/making-their-comeback/article_c46c89fe-e316-11e6-8e83-072c9210971d.html|publisher=oswegocountynewsnow.com|date=January 22, 2017|access-date=December 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has occurred as a [[vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]] twice in Ireland; a juvenile was shot illegally in [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] on January 11, 1973 (misidentified at first as a [[white-tailed eagle]]), and an exhausted juvenile was captured in [[County Kerry|Kerry]] on November 15, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1987/Bald-Eagle-Lands-Exhausted-in-Ireland/id-fd7744016cc242f2c23ec570762c136a |title=Bald Eagle Lands Exhausted in Ireland |agency=Associated Press |date=December 15, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat==
[[File:Bald Eagle, Ontario forest.jpg|thumb|In flight during a licensed performance in Ontario, Canada]]
[[File:Bald Eagle, training for falconry.jpg|thumb|During training at the Canadian Raptor Conservancy, a facility licensed by the province of [[Ontario]]]]
The bald eagle occurs during its breeding season in virtually any kind of American [[wetland]] habitat such as [[Coast|seacoasts]], rivers, large lakes or [[marsh]]es or other large bodies of open water with an abundance of fish. Studies have shown a preference for bodies of water with a circumference greater than {{convert|11|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, and lakes with an area greater than {{convert|10|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us|abbr = on}} are optimal for breeding bald eagles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gov&quot;/&gt;

The bald eagle typically requires old-growth and mature stands of [[pinophyta|coniferous]] or [[hardwood]] trees for perching, roosting, and nesting. Tree species reportedly is less important to the eagle pair than the tree's height, composition and location.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suring&quot;/&gt; Perhaps of paramount importance for this species is an abundance of comparatively large trees surrounding the body of water. Selected trees must have good visibility, be over {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, an open structure, and proximity to prey. If nesting trees are in standing water such as in a mangrove swamp, the nest can be located fairly low, at as low {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPL&quot;/&gt; In a more typical tree standing on dry ground, nests may be located from {{convert|16|to|38|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height. In [[Chesapeake Bay]], nesting trees averaged {{convert|82|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|28|m|ft|abbr=on}} in total height, while in Florida, the average nesting tree stands {{convert|23|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and is {{convert|23|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=j3/&gt;&lt;ref name=j4/&gt; Trees used for nesting in the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem|Greater Yellowstone area]] average {{convert|27|m|ft|abbr=on}} high.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swenson, J. E. 1986&quot;/&gt; Trees or forest used for nesting should have a canopy cover of no more than 60%, and no less than 20%, and be in close proximity to water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gov&quot;/&gt; Most nests have been found within {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of open water. The greatest distance from open water recorded for a bald eagle nest was over {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in Florida.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt;

Bald eagle nests are often very large in order to compensate for size of the birds. The largest recorded nest was found in Florida in 1963, and was measured at nearly 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-10000/largest-birds-nest/ |title=Largest bird's nest |publisher=Guinnessworldrecords.com |access-date=October 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Florida, nesting habitats often consist of [[Mangrove]] swamps, the shorelines of lakes and rivers, [[pine]]lands, seasonally flooded [[flatwoods]], [[Swamp|hardwood swamps]], and open [[prairie]]s and [[pasture]]land with scattered tall trees. Favored nesting trees in Florida are [[Pinus elliottii|slash pines]] (''Pinus elliottii''), [[Pinus palustris|longleaf pines]] (''P. palustris''), [[Pinus taeda|loblolly pines]] (''P. taeda'') and [[Cupressaceae|cypress trees]], but for the southern coastal areas where mangroves are usually used.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPL&quot;/&gt; In [[Wyoming]], groves of mature [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|cottonwoods]] or tall pines found along streams and rivers are typical bald eagle nesting habitats. Wyoming eagles may inhabit habitat types ranging from large, old-growth stands of [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pines]] (''Pinus ponderosa'') to narrow strips of riparian trees surrounded by rangeland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt; In [[Southeast Alaska]], [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]] (''Picea sitchensis'') provided 78% of the nesting trees used by eagles, followed by [[Tsuga|hemlocks]] (''Tsuga'') at 20%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suring&quot;/&gt; Increasingly, eagles nest in man-made reservoirs stocked with fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPL&quot;/&gt;

[[File:2010-bald-eagle-with-fish.jpg|thumb|left|With freshly caught fish in [[Kodiak Island|Kodiak]]]]
The bald eagle is usually quite sensitive to human activity while nesting, and is found most commonly in areas with minimal human disturbance. It chooses sites more than {{convert|1.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} from low-density human disturbance and more than {{convert|1.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from medium- to high-density human disturbance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gov&quot;/&gt; However, bald eagles will occasionally nest in large estuaries or secluded groves within major cities, such as Hardtack Island on the [[Willamette River]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon or [[John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, which are surrounded by a great quantity of human activity.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt;&lt;ref name=r4/&gt; Even more contrary to the usual sensitivity to disturbance, a family of bald eagles moved to the [[Harlem]] neighborhood in New York City in 2010.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt;

While wintering, bald eagles tend to be less habitat and disturbance sensitive. They will commonly congregate at spots with plentiful perches and waters with plentiful prey and (in northern climes) partially unfrozen waters. Alternately, non-breeding or wintering bald eagles, particularly in areas with a lack of human disturbance, spend their time in various upland, terrestrial habitats sometimes quite far away from waterways. In the northern half of North America (especially the interior portion), this terrestrial inhabitance by bald eagles tends to be especially prevalent because unfrozen water may not be accessible. Upland wintering habitats often consist of open habitats with concentrations of medium-sized mammals, such as [[prairie]]s, [[meadow]]s or [[tundra]], or open forests with regular carrion access.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Suring&quot;/&gt;

==Behavior==
The bald eagle is a powerful flier, and soars on [[thermal]] convection currents. It reaches speeds of {{convert|56|–|70|km/h|mph|sp=us|abbr = on}} when gliding and flapping, and about {{convert|48|km/h|mph|sp=us|abbr = on}} while carrying fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terres&quot;/&gt; Its dive speed is between {{convert|120|-|160|km/h|mph|sp=us|abbr = on}}, though it seldom dives vertically.&lt;ref name=r17/&gt; Regarding their flying abilities, despite being morphologically less well adapted to faster flight than golden eagles (especially during dives), the bald eagle is considered surprisingly maneuverable in flight. Bald eagles have also been recorded catching up to and then swooping under geese in flight, turning over and thrusting their talons into the other bird's breast.&lt;ref name= Palmer/&gt; It is partially migratory, depending on location. If its territory has access to open water, it remains there year-round, but if the body of water freezes during the winter, making it impossible to obtain food, it migrates to the south or to the coast. A number of populations are subject to post-breeding dispersal, mainly in juveniles; Florida eagles, for example, will disperse northwards in the summer.&lt;ref name=r8/&gt; The bald eagle selects migration routes which take advantage of [[thermal]]s, [[updraft]]s, and food resources. During migration, it may ascend in a thermal and then glide down, or may ascend in updrafts created by the wind against a cliff or other terrain. Migration generally takes place during the daytime, usually between the local hours of 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., when thermals are produced by the sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt;

==Diet and feeding==
The bald eagle is an opportunistic carnivore with the capacity to consume a great variety of prey. Fish often comprise most of the eagle's diet throughout their range.&lt;ref name=&quot;LPZBaldEagle&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lpzoo.org/animals/factsheet/bald-eagle |title=Bald Eagle Fact Sheet, Lincoln Park Zoo |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531195236/http://www.lpzoo.org/animals/factsheet/bald-eagle |archivedate=May 31, 2012 |website=Lpzoo.org |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 20 food habit studies across the species' range, fish comprised 56% of the diet of nesting eagles, birds 28%, mammals 14% and other prey 2%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stalmaster&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stalmaster |first1=M.V. |year=1987 |title=The Bald Eagle |publisher=Universe Books |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 400 species are known to be included in the bald eagle's prey spectrum, far more than its ecological equivalent in the Old World, the [[white-tailed eagle]], is known to take.

[[File:Bald Eagle and salmon.jpg|Juvenile with [[salmon]], [[Katmai National Park and Preserve|Katmai National Park]]|thumb]]
To hunt fish, the eagle swoops down over the water and snatches the fish out of the water with its [[talons]]. They eat by holding the fish in one claw and tearing the flesh with the other. Eagles have structures on their toes called spicules that allow them to grasp fish. [[Osprey]] also have this adaptation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terres&quot;/&gt; Bird prey may occasionally be attacked in flight, with prey up to the size of [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] attacked and killed in mid-air.&lt;ref name=RaptorsWorld/&gt; It has been estimated that the gripping power (pounds by square inch) of the bald eagle is ten times greater than that of a human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gripping Strength of an Eagle – Understanding psi 101|publisher=Hawkquest|access-date=July 20, 2012|url=http://www.hawkquest.org/TA/XL/Gripping.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bald eagles can fly with fish at least equal to their own weight, but if the fish is too heavy to lift, the eagle may be dragged into the water. It may swim to safety, in some cases pulling the catch along to the shore as it swims, but some eagles drown or succumb to [[hypothermia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Potts1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Potts|first=Steve|title=The Bald Eagle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBUsVf9h5cUC&amp;pg=PA17|access-date=July 12, 2016|year=1999|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-0-7368-8483-9|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many sources claim that bald eagles, like all large eagles, cannot normally take flight carrying prey more than half of their own weight unless aided by favorable wind conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPL&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; On numerous occasions, when large prey such as large fish including mature salmon or geese are attacked, eagles have been seen to make contact and then drag the prey in a strenuously labored, low flight over the water to a bank, where they then finish off and dismember the prey.&lt;ref name=&quot;BNA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= Palmer/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stalmaster&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= Sherrod2/&gt; When food is abundant, an eagle can gorge itself by storing up to {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of food in a pouch in the throat called a crop. Gorging allows the bird to fast for several days if food becomes unavailable.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPL&quot;/&gt; Occasionally, bald eagles may hunt cooperatively when confronting prey, especially relatively large prey such as jackrabbits or herons, with one bird distracting potential prey, while the other comes behind it in order to ambush it.&lt;ref name= Cornell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Edwards |first1=C.C. |year=1969 |title=Winter behavior and population dynamics of American eagles in Utah |journal=PhD Thesis |publisher=Brigham Young University |location=Provo, UT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=j25/&gt; While hunting waterfowl, bald eagles repeatedly fly at a target and cause it to dive repeatedly, hoping to exhaust the victim so it can be caught (white-tailed eagles have been recorded hunting waterfowl in the same way). When hunting concentrated prey, a successful catch often results in the hunting eagle being pursued by other eagles and needing to find an isolated perch for consumption if it is able to carry it away successfully.&lt;ref name=&quot;BNA&quot;/&gt;

They obtain much of their food as [[carrion]] or via a practice known as [[kleptoparasitism]], by which they steal prey away from other predators. Due to their dietary habits, bald eagles are frequently viewed in a negative light by humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt; Thanks to their superior foraging ability and experience, adults are generally more likely to hunt live prey than immature eagles, which often obtain their food from scavenging.&lt;ref name=&quot;Todd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harmata |first1=A.

Behind fish, the next most significant prey base for bald eagles are other [[Water bird|waterbirds]]. The contribution of such birds to the eagle's diet is variable, depending on the quantity and availability of fish near the water's surface.

Due to easy accessibility and lack of formidable nest defense by such species, bald eagles are capable of preying on such seabirds at all ages, from eggs to mature adults, and they can effectively cull large portions of a colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson&quot;/&gt; Along some portions of the North Pacific coastline, bald eagles which had historically preyed mainly [[kelp]]-dwelling fish and supplementally [[sea otter]] (''Enhydra lutris'') pups are now preying mainly on seabird colonies since both the fish (possibly due to overfishing) and otters (cause unknown) have had precipitous population declines, causing concern for seabird conservation.&lt;ref name=&quot;sciencedaily&quot;/&gt; Because of this more extensive predation, some biologist has expressed concern that [[murre]]s are heading for a &quot;conservation collision&quot; due to heavy eagle predation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson&quot;/&gt; Eagles have been confirmed to attack nocturnally active, burrow-nesting seabird species such as [[storm petrel]]s and [[shearwater]]s by digging out their burrows and feeding on all animals they find inside.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nocturnal&quot;/&gt; If a bald eagle flies close by, waterbirds will often fly away en masse, though in other cases they may seemingly ignore a perched eagle. when the birds fly away from a colony, this exposed their unprotected eggs and nestlings to scavengers such as [[gull]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson&quot;/&gt;

Together with the golden eagle, bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially sheep (''Ovis aries''). There are a handful of proven cases of lamb predation, some specimens weighing up to {{convert|11|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, by bald eagles. Still, they are much less likely to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle. Both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICWDM&quot;/&gt; There is one case of a bald eagle killing and feeding on an adult, pregnant ewe (then joined in eating the kill by at least 3 other eagles), which, weighing on average over {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, is much larger than any other known prey taken by this species.&lt;ref name=&quot;McEneaney&quot;/&gt;

===Reptiles and other prey===
Supplemental prey is readily taken given the opportunity. In some areas, reptiles may become regular prey, especially in warm areas such as Florida where reptile diversity is high. Turtles are perhaps the most regularly hunted type of reptile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt; In coastal [[New Jersey]], 14 of 20 studied eagle nests included remains of turtles. The main species found were [[Sternotherus odoratus|common musk turtles]] (''Sternotherus odoratus''), [[diamondback terrapin]] (''Malaclemys terrapin'') and juvenile [[common snapping turtle]]s (''Chelydra serpentina''). In these New Jersey nests, mainly subadult and small adults were taken, ranging in carapace length from {{convert|9.2|to|17.1|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wetlands&quot;/&gt; Similarly, many turtles were recorded in the diet in the [[Chesapeake Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=W.

=== Interspecific predatory relationships ===
[[File:Birds of Prey Wisconsin 08.jpg|thumb|left|Pursuing an [[osprey]] to steal fish.]]
When competing for food, eagles will usually dominate other fish-eaters and scavengers, aggressively displacing [[mammal]]s such as [[coyote]]s (''Canis latrans'') and foxes, and birds such as [[corvid]]s, [[gull]]s, vultures and other [[Bird of prey|raptors]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherrod&quot;/&gt; Occasionally, coyotes, [[bobcat]]s (''Lynx rufus'') and [[Dog|domestic dogs]] (''Canis familiaris'') can displace eagles from carrion, usually less confident immature birds, as has been recorded in Maine.&lt;ref name=j14/&gt; Bald eagles are less active, bold predators than golden eagles and get relatively more of their food as carrion and from kleptoparasitism (although it is now generally thought that golden eagles eat more carrion than was previously assumed).&lt;ref name='Erlandson.'/&gt;&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt; However, the two species are roughly equal in size, aggressiveness and physical strength and so competitions can go either way. Neither species is known to be dominant, and the outcome depends on the size and disposition of the individual eagles involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;BNA&quot;/&gt; Wintering bald and golden eagles in [[Utah]] both sometimes won conflicts, though in one recorded instance a single bald eagle successfully displaced two consecutive golden eagles from a kill.&lt;ref name= Sabine&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sabine |first1=N. |last2=Gardner |first2=K. |year=1987 |title=Agonistic encounters between Bald Eagles and other raptors wintering in west central Utah |journal=Journal of Raptor Research |volume=21 |pages=118–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though bald eagles face few natural threats, an unusual attacker comes in the form of the common loon (''G. immer''), which is also taken by eagles as prey. While common loons normally avoid conflict, they are highly territorial and will attack predators and competitors by stabbing at them with their knife-like bill; as the range of the bald eagle has increased following conservation efforts, these interactions have been observed on several occasions, including a fatality of a bald eagle in Maine that is presumed to have come about as a result of it attacking a nest, then having a fatal [[Penetrating trauma|puncture wound]] inflicted by one or both loon parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=May 27, 2020|title=Why did a loon stab a bald eagle through the heart?|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/05/why-loon-stabbed-bald-eagle-heart/|access-date=December 1, 2020|website=Animals|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bald eagle is thought to be much more numerous in North America than the golden eagle, with the bald species estimated to number at least 150,000 individuals, about twice as many golden eagles there are estimated to live in North America.&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot;/&gt; Due to this, bald eagles often outnumber golden eagles at attractive food sources.&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt; Despite the potential for contention between these animals, in [[New Jersey]] during winter, a golden eagle and numerous bald eagles were observed to hunt [[snow geese]] alongside each other without conflict. Similarly, both eagle species have been recorded, via video-monitoring, to feed on gut piles and carcasses of [[white-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus'') in remote forest clearings in the eastern [[Appalachian Mountains]] without apparent conflict.&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt; Bald eagles as frequently mobbed by smaller raptors, due to their infrequent but unpredictable tendency to hunt other birds of prey.&lt;ref name= Sabine/&gt; Many bald eagles are habitual kleptoparasites, especially in winters when fish are harder to come by. They have been recorded stealing fish from other predators such as [[osprey]]s, [[heron]]s and even [[otter]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;BNA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=j13/&gt; They have also been recorded opportunistically pirating birds from [[peregrine falcon]]s (''Falco peregrinus''), prairie dogs from [[ferruginous hawk]]s (''Buteo regalis'') and even jackrabbits from [[golden eagle]]s.&lt;ref name=j7/&gt;&lt;ref name=j8/&gt; When they approach scavengers such as dogs, gulls or vultures at carrion sites, they often attack them in an attempt to force them to disgorge their food.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPL&quot;/&gt; Healthy adult bald eagles are not preyed upon in the wild and are thus considered [[apex predator]]s.&lt;ref name=r6/&gt;

==Reproduction==
Bald eagles are sexually mature at four or five years of age. When they are old enough to breed, they often return to the area where they were born. It is thought that bald eagles [[mate for life]]. However, if one member of a pair dies or disappears, the survivor will choose a new mate. A pair which has repeatedly failed in breeding attempts may split and look for new mates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinterland&quot;/&gt; Bald eagle courtship involves elaborate, spectacular calls and flight displays by the males. The flight includes swoops, chases, and cartwheels, in which they fly high, lock talons, and free-fall, separating just before hitting the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stalmaster&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=r7/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Scharper |first1=Julie |title=Bald eagles fight, tangle and fall out of the sky |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/features/bs-ae-tangled-bald-eagles-20150127-story.html |access-date=February 14, 2021 |publisher=Baltimore Sun |date=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, a territory defended by a mature pair will be {{convert|1|to|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} of waterside habitat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt;

Compared to most other raptors, which mostly nest in April or May, bald eagles are early breeders: nest building or reinforcing is often by mid-February, egg laying is often late February (sometimes during deep snow in the North), and incubation is usually mid-March and early May. Eggs hatch from mid April to early May, and the young fledge late June to early July.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt; The nest is the largest of any bird in North America; it is used repeatedly over many years and with new material added each year may eventually be as large as {{convert|4|m|ft|sp=us|abbr = on}} deep, {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sp=us|abbr = on}} across and weigh {{convert|1|t|ST|lk=on|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;hbw&quot; /&gt; One nest in Florida was found to be {{convert|6.1|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on}} deep, {{convert|2.9|m|ft|sp=us}} across, and to weigh {{convert|3|ST|t|1|sp=us|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Erickson, L. |year=2007 |publisher=Journey North |url=http://www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/eagle/NestAbout1.html |title=Bald Eagle, About Bald Eagle Nests |access-date=August 27, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830211627/http://www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/eagle/NestAbout1.html |archive-date=August 30, 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; This nest is on record as the largest tree nest ever recorded for any animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trails.com/arts/amazing-bird-records.aspx |title=Amazing Bird Records |website=Trails.com |date=July 27, 2010 |access-date=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually nests are used for under five years, as they either collapse in storms or break the branches supporting them by their sheer weight. However, one nest in the [[Midwest]] was occupied continuously for at least 34 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPL&quot;/&gt; The nest is built of branches, usually in large trees found near water. When breeding where there are no trees, the bald eagle will nest on the ground, as has been recorded largely in areas largely isolated from terrestrial predators, such as [[Amchitka Island]] in Alaska.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherrod&quot;/&gt;

In [[Sonora]], Mexico, eagles have been observed nesting on top of [[Pachycereus pecten-aboriginum|hecho catcuses]] (''Pachycereus pectin-aboriginum'').&lt;ref name=j9/&gt; Nests located on cliffs and rock pinnacles have been reported historically in California, [[Kansas]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]] and [[Utah]], but currently are only verified to occur only in [[Alaska]] and [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt; The eggs average about {{convert|73|mm|in|sp=us|abbr = on}} long, ranging from {{convert|58|to|85|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and have a breadth of {{convert|54|mm|in|sp=us|abbr = on}}, ranging from {{convert|47|to|63|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terres&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stalmaster&quot;/&gt; Eggs in Alaska averaged {{convert|130|g|oz|abbr=on}} in mass, while in [[Saskatchewan]] they averaged {{convert|114.4|g|oz|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hensel, R. J 1964&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bortolotti&quot;/&gt; As with their ultimate body size, egg size tends to increase with distance from the equator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stalmaster&quot;/&gt; Eagles produce between one and three eggs per year, two being typical. Rarely, four eggs have been found in nests, but these may be exceptional cases of [[polygyny]].&lt;ref name=bent/&gt; Eagles in captivity have been capable of producing up to seven eggs.&lt;ref name=j10/&gt; It is rare for all three chicks to successfully reach the fledgling stage. The oldest chick often bears the advantage of larger size and louder voice, which tends to draw the parents' attention towards it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt; Occasionally, as is recorded in many large raptorial birds, the oldest sibling sometimes attacks and kills its younger sibling(s), especially early in the nesting period when their sizes are most different.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt; However, nearly half of known bald eagles produce two fledglings (more rarely three), unlike in some other &quot;eagle&quot; species such as some in the genus ''Aquila'', in which a second fledgling is typically observed in less than 20% of nests, despite two eggs typically being laid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;/&gt; Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs, but the female does most of the sitting. The parent not incubating will hunt for food or look for nesting material during this stage. For the first two to three weeks of the nestling period, at least one adult is at the nest almost 100% of the time. After five to six weeks, the attendance of parents usually drops off considerably (with the parents often perching in trees nearby).&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt;

A young eaglet can gain up to {{convert|170|g|oz|abbr=on}} a day, the fastest growth rate of any North American bird.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPL&quot;/&gt; The young eaglets pick up and manipulate sticks, play tug of war with each other, practice holding things in their talons, and stretch and flap their wings. By eight weeks, the eaglets are strong enough to flap their wings, lift their feet off the nest platform, and rise up in the air.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPL&quot;/&gt; The young fledge at anywhere from 8 to 14 weeks of age, though will remain close to the nest and attended to by their parents for a further 6 weeks. Juvenile eagles first start dispersing away from their parents about 8 weeks after they fledge. Variability in departure date related to effects of sex and hatching order on growth and development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bortolotti&quot;/&gt; For the next four years, immature eagles wander widely in search of food until they attain adult plumage and are eligible to reproduce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drexel&quot;/&gt;

On rare occasions, bald eagles have been recorded to adopt other raptor fledglings into their nests, as seen in 2017 by a pair of eagles in Shoal Harbor Migratory Bird Sanctuary near Sidney, British Columbia. The pair of eagles in question are believed to have carried a juvenile [[red-tailed hawk]] back to their nest, presumably as prey, whereupon the chick was accepted into the family by both the parents and the eagles' three nestlings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40224776|title=Bald eagle adopts 'mortal enemy' baby hawk|date=June 9, 2017|access-date=April 4, 2018|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hawk, nicknamed &quot;Spunky&quot; by biologists monitoring the nest, fledged successfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/07/red-tailed-hawk-adopted-by-bald-eagles-video-spd/|title=Why This Young Hawk Thinks It's an Eagle|date=July 25, 2017|website=nationalgeographic.com|access-date=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Longevity and mortality==
[[File:Fledging Bald Eagle.jpg|thumb|Newly fledged juvenile]]
The average lifespan of bald eagles in the wild is around 20 years, with the oldest confirmed one having been 38 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/14/bald-eagle-believed-oldest-banded-of-its-species-f/ |title=Bald eagle believed oldest banded of its species found dead |publisher=Washington Times (Associated Press) |date=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In captivity, they often live somewhat longer. In one instance, a captive individual in New York lived for nearly 50 years. As with size, the average lifespan of an eagle population appears to be influenced by its location and access to prey.&lt;ref name=sop&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsc-eoc.org/regional/oneaglefacts.html |title=Bald Eagle Fact Sheet |publisher=Southern Ontario Bald Eagle Monitoring Project |access-date=June 30, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511232457/http://www.bsc-eoc.org/regional/oneaglefacts.html |archive-date=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they are no longer heavily persecuted, adult mortality is quite low. In one study of Florida eagles, adult bald eagles reportedly had 100% annual survival rate.&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt; In [[Prince William Sound]] in [[Alaska]], adults had an annual survival rate of 88% even after the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]] adversely affected eagles in the area.&lt;ref name=j16/&gt; Of 1,428 individuals from across the range necropsied by National Wildlife Health Center from 1963 to 1984, 329 (23%) eagles died from trauma, primarily impact with wires and vehicles; 309 (22%) died from gunshot; 158 (11%) died from poisoning; 130 (9%) died from electrocution; 68 (5%) died from trapping; 110 (8%) from emaciation; and 31 (2%) from disease; cause of death was undetermined in 293 (20%) of cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buehler&quot;/&gt; In this study, 68% of mortality was human-caused.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buehler&quot; /&gt; Today, eagle-shooting is believed to be considerably reduced due to the species' protected status.&lt;ref name=b6/&gt; In one case, an adult eagle investigating a peregrine falcon nest for prey items sustained a concussion from a swooping parent peregrine, and ultimately died days later from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/660/articles/behavior |title=Cornell University |publisher=Bna.birds.cornell.edu|access-date=March 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early natural history video depicting a [[cougar]] (''Puma concolor'') ambushing and killing an immature bald eagle feeding at a rabbit carcass is viewable online, although this film may have been staged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Yx1KXQMCM | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211029/_4Yx1KXQMCM| archive-date=2021-10-29|title=Cougar vs Eagle |publisher=YouTube |access-date=April 22, 2013}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most non-human-related mortality involves nestlings or eggs. Around 50% of eagles survive their first year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drexel&quot;/&gt; However, in the Chesapeake Bay area, 100% of 39 radio-tagged nestlings survived to their first year.&lt;ref name=j24/&gt; Nestling or egg fatalities may be due to nest collapses, starvation, sibling aggression or inclement weather. Another significant cause of egg and nestling mortality is predation. Nest predators include large [[gull]]s, [[corvid]]s (including ravens, [[Corvus (genus)|crows]] and [[magpie]]s), [[wolverine]]s (''Gulo gulo''), [[Fisher (animal)|fishers]] (''Pekania pennanti''), [[red-tailed hawk]]s, owls, other [[eagle]]s, bobcats, [[American black bear]]s (''Ursus americanus'') and raccoons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hensel, R. J 1964&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=j17/&gt;&lt;ref name=j18a/&gt;&lt;ref name=j19/&gt;&lt;ref name=j20/&gt;&lt;ref name=j21/&gt;&lt;ref name=j22/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lovallo |first1=M.

===Population decline and recovery===
[[File:Trash eagle.jpg|thumb|Inside a waste collection and transfer facility, in [[Homer, Alaska]], United States]]
Once a common sight in much of the continent, the bald eagle was severely affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide [[DDT]].&lt;ref name=b5/&gt; Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to [[biomagnification]]. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with their [[calcium]] metabolism, making them either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs; many of their eggs were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for them to hatch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bull87&quot;/&gt; It is estimated that the early 18th century the bald eagle population was 300,000–500,000,&lt;ref name=r16/&gt; but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 [[Contiguous United States|contiguous states]] of the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalzoo.si.edu/support/adopt/adopt-bald-eagle|title=Adopt a Bald Eagle|publisher=Smithsonian's National Zoo &amp; Conservation Biology Institute|access-date=August 4, 2018|date=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.sc.gov/wildlife/baldeagle/pastsurveys.html|title=South Carolina's Bald Eagles – Past Surveys|publisher=South Carolina Department of Natural Resources|date=2015|access-date=August 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other factors in bald eagle population reductions were a widespread loss of suitable habitat, as well as both legal and illegal shooting. In 1930 a New York City ornithologist wrote that in the territory of Alaska in the previous 12 years approximately 70,000 bald eagles had been shot. Many of the hunters killed the bald eagles under the long-held beliefs that bald eagles grabbed young lambs and even children with their talons, yet the birds were innocent of most of these alleged acts of predation (lamb predation is rare, human predation is thought to be non-existent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HCoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62 |title=American Bald Eagle Is Near Extinction |journal=Popular Science Monthly |date=March 1930 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illegal shooting was described as &quot;the leading cause of direct mortality in both adult and immature bald eagles&quot; by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Bald Eagle's Status Listed for 48 States |journal=Endangered Species Technical Bulletin |date=March 1978 |volume=III |issue=3 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading causes of death in bald eagles include lead pollution, poisoning, collision with motor vehicles, and power-line electrocution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264861144 |title=Causes of Mortality in Eagles Submitted to The National Wildlife Health Center 1975–2013 |last1=Russell |first1=Robin E. |last2=Franson |first2=J.

The species was first protected in the U.S. and Canada by the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|1918 Migratory Bird Treaty]], later extended to all of North America. The [[Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act]], approved by the U.S. Congress in 1940, protected the bald eagle and the [[golden eagle]], prohibiting commercial trapping and killing of the birds. The bald eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/midwest/eagle/history/protections.html|title=Federal Laws that Protect Bald and Golden Eagles|publisher=US Fish and Wildlife Service|access-date=May 30, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/pacific/ecoservices/BaldEagleDelisting.htm|title=Bald Eagle Removed from Endangered Species List|publisher=US Fish and Wildlife Service|access-date=May 30, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps most significant in the species' recovery, in 1972, DDT was banned from usage in the United States due to the fact that it inhibited the reproduction of many birds.&lt;ref name=r13/&gt; DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989, though its use had been highly restricted since the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=r14/&gt;
[[File:Haliaeetus leucocephalus 38319.JPG|thumb|upright|First-year juvenile bald eagle at [[Anacortes]], Washington United States]]

With regulations in place and DDT banned, the eagle population rebounded. The bald eagle can be found in growing concentrations throughout the United States and Canada, particularly near large bodies of water. In the early 1980s, the estimated total population was 100,000 individuals, with 110,000–115,000 by 1992;&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt; the U.S. state with the largest resident population is [[Alaska]], with about 40,000–50,000, with the next highest population the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]] with 20,000–30,000 in 1992.&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt; Obtaining a precise count of the bald eagle population is extremely difficult. The most recent data submitted by individual states was in 2006, when 9789 breeding pairs were reported.&lt;ref name=&quot;USFWS2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/midwest/eagle/population/chtofprs.html |title=Bald Eagle Breeding Pairs 1963 to 2006 |date=March 18, 2013 |access-date=December 10, 2013 |publisher=U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some time, the stronghold breeding population of bald eagles in the lower 48 states was in Florida, where over a thousand pairs have held on while populations in other states were significantly reduced by DDT use. Today, the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous state]] with the largest number of breeding pairs of eagles is [[Minnesota]] with an estimated 1,312 pairs, surpassing Florida's most recent count of 1,166 pairs. 23, or nearly half, of the 48 contiguous states now have at least 100 breeding pairs of bald eagles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot;/&gt; In Washington State, there were only 105 occupied nests in 1980.  That number increased by about 30 per year, so that by 2005 there were 840 occupied nests. 2005 was the last year that the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife counted occupied nests. Further population increases in Washington may be limited by the availability of late winter food, particularly salmon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wdfw.wa.gov/conservation/endangered/species/bald_eagle.pdf|title=Threatened and Endangered Wildlife in Washington, 2012 Annual Report|publisher=Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife|access-date=March 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320235925/http://wdfw.wa.gov/conservation/endangered/species/bald_eagle.pdf|archive-date=March 20, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bald eagle was officially removed from the U.S. federal government's list of endangered species on July 12, 1995, by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service]], when it was reclassified from &quot;endangered&quot; to &quot;threatened.&quot; On July 6, 1999, a proposal was initiated &quot;To Remove the Bald Eagle in the Lower 48 States From the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife.&quot; It was de-listed on June 28, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Bald Eagle Decline, Protection and Recovery|access-date=May 30, 2020|url=https://www.fws.gov/midwest/eagle/History/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been assigned a risk level of [[least concern]] category on the [[IUCN Red List]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn status 19 November 2021&quot; /&gt; In the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill]] of 1989 an estimated 247 were killed in [[Prince William Sound]], though the local population returned to its pre-spill level by 1995.&lt;ref name= Cornell/&gt; In some areas, the increase in eagles has led to decreases in other bird populations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Parrish|first1=Julia K.|author-link=Julia Parrish|last2=Marvier|first2=Michelle|last3=Paine|first3=Robert T.|title=Direct and Indirect Effects: Interactions Between Bald Eagles and Common Murres|author-link3=Robert T.

[[License|Permits]] are required to keep bald eagles in captivity in the United States. Permits are primarily issued to public educational institutions, and the eagles which they show are permanently injured individuals that cannot be released to the wild.

==Cultural significance==
The bald eagle is important in various [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures and, as the [[national symbol|national bird]] of the United States, is prominent in seals and logos, coinage, postage stamps, and other items relating to the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]].

===Role in Native American culture===
The bald eagle is a sacred bird in some North American cultures, and its feathers, like those of the [[golden eagle]], are central to many religious and [[Native American mythology|spiritual]] customs among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Eagles are considered spiritual messengers between gods and humans by some cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pequot&quot;/&gt; Many [[pow wow]] dancers use the eagle claw as part of their regalia as well. Eagle feathers are often used in traditional ceremonies, particularly in the construction of regalia worn and as a part of fans, bustles and head dresses. In the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] tradition an eagle feather is represented to be a protector, along with the feather Navajo medicine men use the leg and wing bones for ceremonial whistles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baldeagleinfo.com/eagle/eagle-myths.html|title=Eagle Myths and Legends – American Bald Eagle Information|access-date=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lakota people|Lakota]], for instance, give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to person who achieves a task. In modern times, it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melmer&quot;/&gt; The [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] considered eagles as symbols of fertility because their nests are built high off the ground and because they fiercely protect their young.&lt;ref name=&quot;northeast&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/northeast/newsroom/eagle.html |title=Bald Eagle Population Recovery and the Endangered Species Act |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |access-date=November 22, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422103354/http://www.fws.gov/northeast/newsroom/eagle.html |archive-date=April 22, 2014 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Choctaw]] considered the bald eagle, who has direct contact with the upper world of the sun, as a symbol of peace.&lt;ref name=greg_obrien_eagle/&gt;

During the [[Sun Dance]], which is practiced by many [[Plains Indian]] tribes, the eagle is represented in several ways. The eagle nest is represented by the fork of the lodge where the dance is held. A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used during the course of the dance. Also during the dance, a [[medicine man]] may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who seek to be healed. The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that the eagle may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator.&lt;ref name=r11/&gt;

Current [[eagle feather law]] stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain or possess bald or golden eagle feathers for religious or spiritual use. The constitutionality of these laws has been questioned by Native American groups on the basis that it violates the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] by affecting ability to practice their religion freely.&lt;ref name=r9/&gt;&lt;ref name=r10/&gt;

The [[National Eagle Repository]], a division of the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|FWS]], exists as a means to receive, process, and store bald and [[golden eagle]]s which are found dead and to distribute the eagles, their parts and feathers to [[List of federally recognized tribes|federally recognized]] Native American tribes for use in religious ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/le/national-eagle-repository.html |title=U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement / Native Americans and Alaskan Natives – National Eagle Repository |access-date=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National bird of the United States===
{{Further|Great Seal of the United States#Obverse}}
[[File:Seal of the President of the United States.svg|thumb|upright|[[Seal of the President of the United States]]]]
The bald eagle is the national bird of the United States of America.&lt;ref name=j23/&gt; The founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the [[Roman Republic]], in which eagle imagery (usually involving the [[golden eagle]]) was prominent. On June 20, 1782, the [[Continental Congress]] adopted the design for the [[Great Seal of the United States]], depicting a bald eagle grasping 13 [[arrow]]s and an [[olive branch]] with thirteen leaves with its talons.&lt;ref name=&quot;seal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;seal2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;seal3&quot;/&gt;

The bald eagle appears on most official seals of the U.S. government, including the [[Seal of the President of the United States|presidential seal]], the [[Flag of the President of the United States|presidential flag]], and in the logos of many U.S. federal agencies. Between 1916 and 1945, the presidential flag (but not the seal) showed an eagle facing to its left (the viewer's right), which gave rise to the [[urban legend]] that the flag is changed to have the eagle face towards the olive branch in peace, and towards the arrows in wartime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/history/american/turnhead.htm |title=A Turn of the Head|access-date=August 19, 2007|author1=Mikkelson, Barbara  |author2=Mikkelson, David P  |name-list-style=amp |publisher=snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to popular legend, there is no evidence that [[Benjamin Franklin]] ever publicly supported the [[wild turkey]] (''Meleagris gallopavo''), rather than the bald eagle, as a symbol of the United States. However, in a letter written to his daughter in 1784 from Paris, criticizing the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], he stated his personal distaste for the bald eagle's behavior. In the letter Franklin states:&lt;ref name= Cornell1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/bald_eagle/lifehistory |title=Bald Eagle, Life History, All About Birds – Cornell Lab of Ornithology |website=AllAboutBirds.org |access-date=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Blockquote|For my own part. I wish the bald eagle had not been chosen the representative of our country. He is a bird of bad moral character. He does not get his living honestly&amp;nbsp;... besides he is a rank coward: The little [[Eastern kingbird|king bird]] not bigger than a sparrow attacks him boldly and drives him out of the district.}}

Franklin opposed the creation of the Society because he viewed it, with its hereditary membership, as a [[order (honour)|noble order]] unwelcome in the newly independent Republic, contrary to the ideals of [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus]], for whom the Society was named.  His reference to the two kinds of birds is interpreted as a satirical comparison between the Society of the Cincinnati and Cincinnatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=MMM.Turkey |title=American Heraldry Society &amp;#124; MMM / The Arms of the United States: Benjamin Franklin and the Turkey |publisher=Americanheraldry.org |date=May 18, 2007 |access-date=March 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427082418/http://www.americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=MMM.Turkey |archive-date=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular culture===
Largely because of its role as a symbol of the United States, but also because of its being a large predator, the bald eagle has many representations in popular culture. In film and television depictions the call of the [[red-tailed hawk]], which is much louder and more powerful, is often substituted for bald eagles.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Robinson, &quot;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=156187375 Bald Eagle: A Mighty Symbol, With A Not-So-Mighty Voice]&quot;; [[NPR]], July 2, 2012; accessed 2019.08.23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution and taxonomy==
The brown bear is sometimes referred to as the {{lang|enm|bruin}}, from [[Middle English]]. This name originated in the fable ''History of [[Reynard the Fox]]'' translated by [[William Caxton]] from [[Middle Dutch]] {{lang|dum|bruun}} or {{lang|dum|bruyn}}, meaning ''brown'' (the color).&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|bruin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bruin Bruin], ''Encyclopaedia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-19th century United States, the brown bear was termed &quot;Old Ephraim&quot; and sometimes as &quot;Moccasin Joe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rooseeltv&quot;&gt;[https://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/Hunting-the-Grisly-and-Other-Sketches1/#p58 Hunting the Grisly and other Sketches]. FullTextArchive.com. Retrieved 15 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific name of the brown bear, ''Ursus arctos'', comes from the Latin {{lang|la|[[Bear#Etymology|ursus]]}}, meaning &quot;bear&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, Henry George and Scott, Robert. [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dursus &quot;Ursus.&quot;] ''A Latin Dictionary''. Perseus Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt; and from {{lang|grc|ἄρκτος}} {{transliteration|grc|arktos}}, the Greek word for bear.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, Henry George and Scott, Robert.[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2315199 &quot;Arktos.&quot;] ''A Greek-English Lexicon''.

===Generalized names and evolution===
Brown bears are thought to have evolved from ''[[Ursus etruscus]]'' in Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;evolution&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pérez-Hidalgo, T. |year=1992 |title=The European descendants of ''Ursus etruscus'' C.

Several paleontologists suggest the possibility of two separate brown bear migrations: inland brown bears, also known as [[Grizzly bear|grizzlies]], are thought to stem from narrow-skulled bears which migrated from northern Siberia to central Alaska and the rest of the continent, while Kodiak bears descend from [[Kamchatka brown bear|broad-skulled bears from Kamchatka]], which colonized the [[Alaskan peninsula]]. Brown bear fossils discovered in [[Ontario]], [[Ohio]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Labrador Peninsula|Labrador]] show that the species occurred farther east than indicated in historic records.&lt;ref name=&quot;evolution&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McLellan |first1=Bruce |last2=Reiner |first2=David C. |year=1994 |title=A Review of bear evolution |url=http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_9/McLellan_Reiner_Vol_9.pdf |journal=Int.

===Scientific taxonomy===
{{main|Subspecies of brown bear}}
[[File:Eurasian brown bear (Ursus arctos arctos) female 1.jpg|thumb|right|Adult female [[Eurasian brown bear]], the [[nominate subspecies]]]]
There are many methods used by scientists to define bear [[species]] and [[subspecies]], as no one method is always effective. Brown bear taxonomy and subspecies classification has been described as &quot;formidable and confusing,&quot; with few authorities listing the same specific set of subspecies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Wilson |first1=D. E. |last2=Ruff |first2=S. |year=1999 |title=The Smithsonian Book of North American Mammals |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution Press]] |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic testing is now perhaps the most important way to scientifically define brown bear relationships and names. Generally, genetic testing uses the word [[clade]] rather than species because a genetic test alone cannot define a [[biological species]]. Most genetic studies report on how closely related the bears are (or their [[genetic distance]]). There are hundreds of obsolete brown bear subspecies, each with its own name, and this can become confusing; Hall (1981) lists 86 different types, and even as many as 90 have been proposed.&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Arthur H.|title=Pleistocene Vertebrates of Arizona, New Mexico, and Trans-Pecos Texas|date=2013|publisher=UTEP Biodiversity Collections, University of Texas at El Paso}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Storer1955&gt;{{cite book |last1=Storer |first1=T.I. |last2=Tevis |first2=L.P. |title=California Grizzly |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QVZFQu01KcC&amp;pg=PA149 |url-access=registration |year=1996 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley, CA]] |isbn=978-0-520-20520-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/californiagrizzl00stor/page/335 335], 42–187}} [https://archive.org/details/californiagrizzl00stor Alt URL]&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent DNA analysis has identified as few as five main clades which contain all extant brown bears,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bearinfo.org/YESFedRegister.pdf |title=Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Designating the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem Population of Grizzly Bears as a Distinct Population Segment; Removing the Yellowstone Distinct Population Segment of Grizzly Bears From the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife |author=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |date=17 November 2006 |journal=Federal Register |volume=70 |issue=221 |pages=69854–69884 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825042929/http://www.bearinfo.org/YESFedRegister.pdf |archive-date=25 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Calvignac, S. |author2=Hughes, S. |author3=Tougard, C. |author4=Michaux, J. |author5=Thevenot, M. |author6=Philippe, M. |author7=Hamdine, W.|author8=Hanni, C.|title=Ancient DNA evidence for the loss of a highly divergent brown bear clade during historical times |journal=[[Molecular Ecology]] |year=2008 |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages=1962–1970 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294x.2008.03631.x |pmid=18363668|s2cid=23361337 |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00287307/file/calvignac2008.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; while a 2017 phylogenetic study revealed nine clades, including one representing polar bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;lan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lan, T. |author2=Gill, S. |author3=Bellemain, E. |author4=Bischof, R. |author5=Zawaz, M.

As well as the exact number of overall brown bear subspecies, its precise relationship to the [[polar bear]] also remains in debate. The polar bear is a recent offshoot of the brown bear. The point at which the polar bear diverged from the brown bear is unclear, with estimations based on genetics and fossils ranging from 400,000 to 70,000 years ago, but most recent analysis has indicated that the polar bear split somewhere between 275,000 and 150,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lindqvist, C. |author2=Schuster, S.

A grizzly–polar bear hybrid (known either as a ''pizzly bear'' or a ''grolar bear'') is a rare [[ursid hybrid]] resulting from a crossbreeding of a brown bear and a [[polar bear]]. It has occurred both in captivity and in the wild. In 2006, the occurrence of this hybrid in nature was confirmed by testing the [[DNA]] of a strange-looking bear that had been shot in the Canadian [[Arctic]], and seven more hybrids have since been confirmed in the same region, all descended from a single female polar bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Richardson|first1=Evan|last2=Branigan|first2=Marsha|last3=Paetkau|first3=David|last4=Pongracz|first4=Jodie D.|date=31 May 2017|title=Recent Hybridization between a Polar Bear and Grizzly Bears in the Canadian Arctic|journal=Arctic|volume=70|issue=#2|pages=151–160|doi=10.14430/arctic4643|issn=1923-1245|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the hybrid had been produced in [[zoo]]s and was considered a &quot;[[Cryptozoology|cryptid]]&quot; (a hypothesized animal for which there is no scientific proof of existence in the wild).

==Description==
[[File:Brown bear (Ursus arctos arctos) smiling.jpg|thumb|right|Brown bears are highly variable in size. Eurasian brown bears often fall around the middle to low sizes for the species.]]
The brown bear is the most variable in size of modern bears. The typical size depends upon which population it is from, and most accepted subtypes vary widely in size. This is in part due to [[sexual dimorphism]], as male brown bears average at least 30% larger in most subtypes. Individual bears also vary in size seasonally, weighing the least in spring due to lack of foraging during hibernation, and the most in late fall, after a period of hyperphagia to put on additional weight to prepare for hibernation. Therefore, a bear may need to be weighed in both spring and fall to get an idea of its mean annual weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hissa, R. |author2=Siekkinen, J. |author3=Hohtola, E. |author4=Saarela, S. |author5=Hakala, A. |author6=Pudas, J. |year=1994|title=Seasonal patterns in the physiology of the European brown bear (''Ursus arctos arctos'') in Finland|pmid=8529017|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Physiology|volume= 109|issue=#3|pages= 781–791|doi=10.1016/0300-9629(94)90222-4|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14671511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= McLellan&gt;{{cite journal|author=McLellan, B.

Adults have massive, heavily built [[wikt:concave|concave]] skulls, which are large in proportion to the body. The forehead is high and rises steeply.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; The projections of the skull are well developed when compared to those of [[Asian black bear]]s (''Ursus thibetanus''): the latter have [[sagittal crest]]s not exceeding more than 19–20% of the total length of the skull, while the former have sagittal crests comprising up to 40–41% of the skull's length. Skull projections are more weakly developed in females than in males. The [[braincase]] is relatively small and elongated.

Brown bears were once native to Europe, much of Asia, the [[Atlas Mountains]] of Africa, and North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4003325.stm |title=Ancient bear made early migration |work=[[BBC News]] |date=12 November 2004 |access-date=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are now [[extirpated]] in some areas, and their populations have greatly decreased in other areas.

The Alaskan population is estimated at a healthy 32,000 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brown Bear Research in Alaska|url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&amp;articles_id=551|publisher=Alaska Department of Fish and Game|access-date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lower 48 states, they are repopulating slowly, but steadily along the Rockies and the western Great Plains.

In Europe, in 2010, there were 14,000&amp;nbsp;brown bears in ten fragmented populations, from Spain (estimated at only 20–25 animals in the [[Pyrenees]] in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.elperiodico.cat/ca/noticias/societat/20100802/neixen-quatre-cries-dos-bru-als-pirineus/416750.shtml|date=2 August 2010|work=elperiodico.cat | title = Neixen quatre cries d'ós bru als Pirineus | access-date = 19 November 2010 | language = ca, es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ecologistasenaccion.org/article17611.html|date=May 2010|publisher=ecologistasenaccion.org | title = Situació preocupant de l'ós bru als Pirineus | access-date = 19 November 2010 | language = ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a range shared between Spain, France and [[Andorra]], and some 210 animals in [[Asturias]], [[Cantabria]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Province of León|León]], in the [[Picos de Europa]] and adjacent areas in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.es/sociedad/20130929/abci-osos-desafio-poblacion-creciente-201309281954.html |work= ABC|location=Spain | title = Osos, el desafío de una población creciente|date= 28 September 2013| language = es}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in the west, to Russia in the east, and from Sweden and [[Finland]] in the north to [[Romania]] (5000–6000), [[Bulgaria]] (900–1200), [[Slovakia]] (with about 600–800 animals), [[Slovenia]] (500–700 animals) and [[Greece]] (with about 200 animals) in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/species/profiles/mammals/brown_bear2/brownbear_population_distribution/|work=wwf.panda.org | title = Brown Bear – Population &amp; Distribution: A Truly International Species| access-date = 19 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, brown bears are found primarily throughout Russia, thence more spottily southwest to parts of the Middle East, including almost all parts of [[Kurdistan]], to as far south as southwestern [[Iran]], and to the southeast in Northeast China. Brown bears are also found in Western [[China]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[North Korea]], [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[India]]. They can also be found on the Japanese island of [[Hokkaidō]], which holds the largest number of non-Russian brown bears in eastern Asia with about 2,000–3,000 animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;&gt;''Carnivores of the World'' by Dr. Luke Hunter. Princeton University Press (2011), {{ISBN|9780691152288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This species inhabits the broadest range of habitats of any living bear species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt;
They seem to have no altitudinal preferences and have been recorded from sea level to an elevation of {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on}} (the latter in the [[Himalayas]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; In most of their range, brown bears generally seem to prefer semiopen country, with a scattering of vegetation that can allow them a resting spot during the day. However, they have been recorded as inhabiting every variety of northern [[temperate forest]] known to occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt;

===Conservation status===
While the brown bear's range has shrunk and it has faced local extinctions, it remains listed as a [[Least concern]] species by the [[IUCN]], with a total population of approximately 200,000. {{as of|2012}}, this and the [[American black bear]] are the only bear species not classified as threatened by the IUCN.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn status 19 November 2021&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name= Servheen/&gt; However, the [[California grizzly bear]], [[Ungava brown bear]], [[Atlas bear]] and [[Mexican grizzly bear]], as well as brown bear populations in the [[Pacific Northwest]], were hunted to extinction in the 19th and early 20th centuries and many of the southern Asian subspecies are highly endangered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller &amp; Waits 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=CR|last2=Waits|first2=L.P.|title=Phylogeography and mitochondrial diversity of extirpated brown bear (''Ursus arctos'') populations in the contiguous United States and Mexico|journal=Mol.

Several different facial expressions have been documented in brown bears. The &quot;relaxed-face&quot; is made in everyday activities and has the ears pointed to the sides and the mouth closed or slackly open. During social play, bears makes &quot;relaxed open-mouth face&quot; in which the mouth is open, with a curled upper lip and hanging lower lip, and the ears alert and shifting. When looking at another animal at a distance, the bear makes an &quot;alert face&quot; as the ears are cocked and alert, the eyes wide open but the mouth is closed or only open slightly. The &quot;tense closed mouth face&quot; is made with the ears laid back and the mouth closed and occurs when the bear feels threatened. When approached by another individual, the animal makes a &quot;puckered-lip face&quot; with a protruding upper lip and ears which go from cocked and alert when at a certain distance to laid back when closer or when retreating. The &quot;jaw gape face&quot; consists of an open mouth with visible lower canines and hanging lips while the &quot;biting face&quot; is similar to the &quot;relaxed open-mouth face&quot; except the ears are flattened and the eyes are wide enough to expose the [[sclera]]. Both the &quot;jaw gape face&quot; and the &quot;biting face&quot; are made in aggression and bears switch between them.&lt;ref name=Egbert&gt;{{cite thesis |author= Egbert, A. L.|year=1978 |title=The Social Behavior of Brown Bears at McNeil River, Alaska|publisher=[[Utah State University]] |degree=[[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] |url=https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/etd/2101/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown bears also produce various vocalizations. Huffing occurs when the animal is tense while woofing is made when it is startled. Both sounds are produced by exhalations though huffing is harsher and is made repeatedly (two per second) while a woof is made only once. Growls and [[Roar (vocalization)|roar]]s are made in aggression. Growling is harsh and [[guttural]] and can range from short and low ''grrr'' to a continuous rolling rumble. A rumbling growl can escalate into a roar when the bear is charging. Roaring is described as &quot;thunderous&quot; and can be heard {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} away. Bears will bawl when seeking contact, such as between mothers and cubs or a male to a potential mate. This sound is heard as ''waugh!, waugh!''.&lt;ref name=Egbert/&gt;

===Home ranges===
Brown bears usually occur over vast home ranges; however, they are not highly territorial. Several adult bears often roam freely over the same vicinity without issue, unless rights to a fertile female or food sources are being contested.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt;&lt;ref name= Dahle/&gt; Males always cover more area than females each year. Despite their lack of traditional territorial behavior, adult males can seem to have a &quot;personal zone&quot; in which other bears are not tolerated if they are seen.&lt;ref name= Pearson&gt;Pearson, A. M. (1975). ''The northern interior grizzly bear Ursus arctos L.

===Dietary habits===
{{Main|Dietary biology of the brown bear}}
[[File:Brown Bear Feeding on Salmon.jpg|thumb|upright|Brown bear feeding on [[salmon]]]]
The brown bear is one of the most [[omnivorous]] animals in the world and has been recorded as consuming the greatest variety of foods of any bear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; Throughout life, this species is regularly curious about the potential of eating virtually any organism or object that they encounter. Food that is both abundant and easily accessed or caught is preferred. Their jaw structure has evolved to fit their dietary habits. Their diet varies enormously throughout their differing areas based on opportunity.

Despite their reputation, most brown bears are not highly carnivorous, as they derive up to 90% of their dietary [[food energy]] from vegetable matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dced.state.ak.us/oed/student_info/learn/bearwatching.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415202025/http://www.dced.state.ak.us/oed/student_info/learn/bearwatching.htm |archive-date=15 April 2009 |title=Alaska is bear territory!|work=Alaska Office of Economic Development |publisher=Dced.state.ak.us |access-date=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often feed on a variety of plant life, including [[Berry|berries]], grasses, [[flower]]s, [[acorn]]s and [[pine cone]]s, as well as fungi such as [[mushroom]]s.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; Among all bears, brown bears are uniquely equipped to dig for tough foods such as [[root]]s, [[bulb]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;Ursus arctos Brown bear&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Ursus_arctos/|title = Ursus arctos (Brown bear)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[shoot]]s. They use their long, strong claws to dig out earth to reach the roots and their powerful jaws to bite through them.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; In spring, winter-provided carrion, grasses, shoots, [[Carex|sedges]], [[moss]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Ursus arctos Brown bear&quot;/&gt; and [[forb]]s are the dietary mainstays for brown bears internationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; Fruits, including berries, become increasingly important during summer and early autumn. Roots and bulbs become critical in autumn for some inland bear populations if fruit crops are poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; They will also commonly consume animal matter, which in summer and autumn may regularly be in the form of insects, [[larvae]] and [[Larva|grubs]], including [[beehive]]s. Bears in Yellowstone eat an enormous number of [[moth]]s during the summer, sometimes as many as 40,000 [[Army cutworm]] moths in a single day, and may derive up to half of their annual food energy from these insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yellowstonepark.com/MoreToKnow/ShowNewsDetails.aspx?newsid=163 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715011549/http://www.yellowstonepark.com/moretoknow/shownewsdetails.aspx?newsid=163 |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 July 2010 |title=Yellowstone Grizzly Bears Eat 40,000 Moths a Day In August |publisher=Yellowstonepark.com |date=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown bears living near coastal regions will regularly eat crabs and [[clam]]s. In Alaska, bears along the beaches of estuaries regularly dig through the sand for clams.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; This species may eat birds and their [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s, including almost entirely ground- or rock-nesting species.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; The diet may be supplemented by [[rodent]]s or similar smallish [[mammal]]s, including [[marmot]]s, [[ground squirrel]]s, [[Mouse|mice]], rats, [[lemming]]s and [[vole]]s.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; With particular regularity, bears in [[Denali National Park]] will wait at burrows of [[Arctic ground squirrel]]s hoping to pick off a few of the {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}} rodents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weaselwords.com/page/ferret_art036.php|title=Inherited behavior traits of the domesticated ferret|last=Brown|first=Susan, A|date=17 January 2010|publisher=weaselwords.com|access-date=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Kamchatka peninsula and several parts of coastal Alaska, brown bears feed mostly on spawning [[salmon]], whose nutrition and abundance explain the enormous size of the bears in these areas. The fishing techniques of bears are well-documented. They often congregate around falls when the salmon are forced to breach the water, at which point the bears will try to catch the fish in mid-air (often with their mouths). They will also wade into shallow waters, hoping to pin a slippery salmon with their claws. While they may eat almost all the parts of the fish, bears at the peak of spawning, when there is usually a glut of fish to feed on, may eat only the most nutrious parts of the salmon (including the eggs and head) and then indifferently leave the rest of the carcass to scavengers, which can include [[red fox]]es, [[bald eagle]]s, [[common raven]]s and [[gull]]s. Despite their normally solitary habits, brown bears will gather rather closely in numbers at good spawning sites. The largest and most powerful males claim the most fruitful fishing spots and bears (especially males) will sometimes fight over the rights to a prime fishing spot.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Moose mom with calves and a bear, Deanli National Park.png|thumb|A cow moose with calves being approached by an inland brown bear, [[Denali National Park]], Alaska]]
Beyond the regular predation of salmon, most brown bears are not particularly active predators.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; While perhaps a majority of bears of the species will charge at large prey at one point in their lives and most eat carrion, many predation attempts start with the bear clumsily and half-heartedly pursuing the prey and end with the prey escaping alive.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; On the other hand, some brown bears are quite self-assured predators who habitually pursue and catch large prey items. Such bears are usually taught how to hunt by their mothers from an early age.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; Large mammals preyed on can include various [[ungulate]] species such as [[elk]], [[moose]], [[Reindeer|caribou]], [[muskox]]en, [[wild boar]],&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; [[Bighorn sheep|mountain sheep]] and [[mountain goat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Ursus_arctos/ | title=Ursus arctos (Brown bear) }}&lt;/ref&gt; When brown bears attack these large animals, they usually target young or infirm ones, as they are easier to catch.

When forced to live in close proximity with humans and their domesticated animals, bears may potentially predate any type of domestic animal. Among these, domestic cattle are sometimes exploited as prey. Cattle are bitten on the neck, back or head and then the abdominal cavity is opened for eating.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; Plants and fruit farmed by humans are readily consumed as well, including [[Maize|corn]], wheat, [[sorghum]], melons and any form of [[Berry|berries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; They will also feed at domestic [[Beekeeping|bee yards]], readily consuming both honey and the brood (grubs and pupae) of the [[honey bee]] colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; Human foods and trash or refuse is eaten when possible. When an open garbage dump was kept in Yellowstone, brown bears were one of the most voracious and regular scavengers.

Brown bears regularly intimidate [[wolf|wolves]] to drive them away from their kills. In [[Yellowstone National Park]], bears pirate wolf kills so often, Yellowstone's Wolf Project director Doug Smith wrote, &quot;It's not a matter of if the bears will come calling after a kill, but when.&quot; Despite the high animosity between the two species, most confrontations at kill sites or large carcasses end without bloodshed on either side. Though conflict over carcasses is common, on rare occasions, the two predators tolerate each other on the same kill. To date, there is a single case of fully-grown wolves being killed by a grizzly bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=122 |issue=1 |year=2008 |title= Gray Wolves, ''Canis lupus'', Killed by Cougars, ''Puma concolor'', and a Grizzly Bear, ''Ursus arctos'', in Montana, Alberta, and Wyoming |author1= Jimenez, Michael D. |author2=Asher, Valpa J. |author3=Bergman, Carita |author4=Bangs, Edward E. |author5=Woodruff, Susannah P. |journal=The Canadian Field-Naturalist |page=76|doi=10.22621/cfn.v122i1.550 |doi-access=free }} [http://mountainlion.org/US/WY/WY%20R%20Jimenez%20et%20al%202008%20Gray%20Wolves%20Killed%20by%20Cougars%20and%20Grizzly%20Bears%20in%20Montana,%20Alberta,%20and%20Wyoming%20-%20Canadian%20Field%20Naturalist.pdf PDF] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210119030500/https://mountainlion.org/US/WY/WY%20R%20Jimenez%20et%20al%202008%20Gray%20Wolves%20Killed%20by%20Cougars%20and%20Grizzly%20Bears%20in%20Montana,%20Alberta,%20and%20Wyoming%20-%20Canadian%20Field%20Naturalist.pdf |date=19 January 2021 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the opportunity, however, both species will prey on the other's cubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Downey, Betsy |title=Personal Encounter.

Brown bears usually dominate other bear species in areas where they coexist. Due to their smaller size, [[American black bear]]s are at a competitive disadvantage to grizzly bears in open, unforested areas. Although displacement of black bears by grizzly bears has been documented, actual interspecific killing of black bears by grizzlies has only occasionally been reported. Confrontation is mostly avoided due to the black bear's diurnal habits and preference for heavily forested areas, as opposed to the grizzly's largely nocturnal habits and preference for open spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/upload/predation.pdf|title=Probable grizzly bear predation on an American black bear in Yellowstone National Park |author1=Gunther, Kerry A. |author2=Biel, Mark J. |author3=Anderson, Neil |author4=Watts, Lisette |year=2002 |journal=[[Ursus (journal)|Ursus]] |volume=13 |pages=372–374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown bears may also kill [[Asian black bear]]s, though the latter species probably largely avoids conflicts with the brown bear, due to similar habits and habitat preferences to the American black species.&lt;ref name=&quot;denning&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_14_2/Seryodkin_14_2.pdf |title=Denning ecology of brown bears and Asiatic black bears in the Russian Far East|jstor=3873015|author=Seryodkin, Ivan V.|journal=Ursus|volume=14|issue= 2 |year=2003|pages=153–161|last2=Kostyria|first2=A.

The brown bear has a naturally long life. Wild females have been observed reproducing up to 28 years of age, which is the oldest known age for reproduction of any [[Bear|ursid]] in the wild.

When brown bears come to associate human activity with a &quot;food reward&quot;, they are likely to continue to become emboldened; the likelihood of human-bear encounters increases, as they may return to the same location despite relocation. Relocation of the bear has been used to separate the bear from the human environment, but it does not address the problem of the bear's newly learned association of humans with food or the environmental situations which created the human-habituated bear. &quot;Placing a bear in habitat used by other bears may lead to competition and social conflict, and result in the injury or death of the less dominant bear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bearsmart.com/managingBears/Relocation.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/2006.05.13-075036/http://www.bearsmart.com/managingBears/Relocation.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 May 2006|title=Relocation|work=Get Bear Smart Society }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yellowstone National Park]], a reserve located in the western United States, contains prime habitat for the grizzly bear (''Ursus arctos horribilis'') and due to the enormous number of visitors, human-bear encounters are common. The scenic beauty of the area has led to an influx of people moving into the area. In addition, because there are so many bear relocations to the same remote areas of Yellowstone, and because male bears tend to dominate the center of the relocation zone, female bears tend to be pushed to the boundaries of the region and beyond. As a result, a large proportion of repeat offenders, bears that are killed for public safety, are females. This creates a further depressive effect on an already-endangered subspecies. The grizzly bear is officially described as &quot;Threatened&quot; in the U.S.. Although the problem is most significant with regard to grizzlies, these issues affect the other types of brown bears as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gunther, K. A. |author2=Haroldson, M.

In Europe, part of the problem lies with [[shepherd]]s; over the past two centuries, many sheep and goat herders have gradually abandoned the more traditional practice of using dogs to guard flocks, which have concurrently grown larger. Typically, they allow the herds to graze freely over sizeable tracts of land. As brown bears reclaim parts of their range, they may eat livestock as sheep and goats are relatively easy for a bear to kill. In some cases, the shepherds shoot the bear, thinking their livelihood is under threat. Many are now better informed about the ample compensation available and will make a claim when they lose livestock to a bear.&lt;ref name= Mustoni&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mustoni, A. |author2=Carlini, E. |author3=Chiarenzi, B. |author4=Chiozzini, S. |author5=Lattuada, E. |author6=Dupré, E. |author7=Genovesi, P. |author8=Pedrotti, L. |author9=Martinoli, A. |author10=Preatoni, D. |author11=Wauters, L. |author12=Tosi, G. |display-authors=3 |title=Planning the Brown Bear ''Ursus arctos'' reintroduction in the Adamello Brenta Natural Park |journal=Hystrix: The Italian Journal of Mammalogy |volume=14 |issue=1–2 |doi=10.4404/hystrix-14.1-2-4313 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Dahle2&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dahle |first1=B. |last2=Sørensen |first2=O.

Sows with cubs account for many attacks on humans by brown bears in North America. [[Habituation|Habituated]] or food-conditioned bears can also be dangerous, as their long-term exposure to humans causes them to lose their natural shyness and, in some cases, to associate humans with food. Small parties of one or two people are more often attacked by brown bears than large groups, with only one known case of an attack on a group of six or more. In that instance, it is thought that due to surprise, the grizzly bear may not have recognized the size of the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOLS 2011 bear attack&quot;&gt;Medred, Craig (26 July 2011) [http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/alaska-bear-attack-nols-kids-did-phenomenal-job Alaska bear attack: NOLS kids did a 'phenomenal job'], ''[[Alaska Dispatch]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the majority of attacks resulting in injury, brown bears precede the attack with a growl or huffing sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;attack&quot;/&gt; In contrast to injuries caused by American black bears, which are usually minor, brown bear attacks more often tend to result in serious injury and, in some cases, death.&lt;ref name=&quot;attack&quot;/&gt; Brown bears seem to confront humans as they would when fighting other bears: they rise up on their hind legs, and attempt to &quot;disarm&quot; their victims by biting and holding on to the lower jaw to avoid being bitten in turn.&lt;ref name=&quot;geist&quot;/&gt; Due to the bears' enormous physical strength, even a single bite or swipe can be deadly as in tigers, with some human victims having had their heads completely crushed by a bear bite.&lt;ref name=&quot;living&quot;&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/livinganimalsofw01cornrich#page/n7/mode/2up ''The living animals of the world; a popular natural history with one thousand illustrations'' Volume 1: Mammals], by [[Charles John Cornish|Cornish, C.

Campers are often told to wear bright-colored red ribbons and bells and carry whistles to ward off bears. They are told to look for grizzly bear dung in camping areas and be careful to carry the bells and whistles in those areas. Grizzly bear dung is difficult to differentiate from American black bear dung, as diet is in a constant state of flux depending on the availability of seasonal food items. If a bear is killed near camp, the bear's carcass must be adequately disposed of, including entrails and blood, if possible. Failure to move the carcass has often resulted in it attracting other bears and further exacerbating a bad situation. Moving camps immediately is another recommended method.&lt;ref name=&quot;attack&quot;/&gt;

Brown bears often figure into the literature of Europe and North America, in particular that which is written for children. &quot;[[The Brown Bear of Norway]]&quot; is a Scottish [[fairy tale]] telling the adventures of a girl who married a prince magically turned into a bear and who managed to get him back into a human form by the force of her love and after many trials and difficulties. With &quot;[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]&quot;, a story from England, the Three Bears are usually depicted as brown bears. In German-speaking countries, children are often told the fairytale of &quot;[[Snow White and Rose Red]]&quot;; the handsome prince in this tale has been transfigured into a brown bear. In the United States, parents often read their preschool age children the book ''[[Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?]]'' to teach them their colors and how they are associated with different animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Newman, A.

The [[Russian bear]] is a common [[national personification]] for Russia (as well as the former [[Soviet Union]]), despite the country having no appointed national animal.

The coat of arms of [[Madrid]] depicts a bear reaching up into a ''madroño'' or [[Arbutus unedo|strawberry tree]] (''Arbutus unedo'') to eat some of its fruit, whereas the Swiss city of [[Bern]]'s coat of arms also depicts a bear and the city's name is popularly thought to derive from the German word for bear. The brown bear is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 5 [[Croatian kuna|kuna]] coin, minted since 1993.

The [[Bundesliga]] club [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] has a brown bear mascot named Berni. The Chicago [[National Football League]] (NFL) franchise is named the [[Chicago Bears|Bears]]. In this context, no differentiation between American black and brown bears is needed. The school mascot for [[Bob Jones University]], [[Brown University]], [[Cornell University]], [[George Fox University]], the [[University of Alberta]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], the [[University of California, Riverside]], and numerous American high schools is the brown bear.

In the town of [[Prats de Molló]], in [[Vallespir]], French Catalonia, a &quot;bear festival&quot; (''festa de l'ós'') is celebrated annually at the beginning of spring, in which the locals dress up as bears, cover themselves with soot or coal and oil and &quot;attack&quot; the onlookers, attempting to get everyone dirty. The festival ends with the ''ball de l'ós'' (bear dance).

{{short description|Microscopic theory of superconductivity}}
'''BCS theory''' or '''Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer theory''' (named after [[John Bardeen]], [[Leon Cooper]], and [[John Robert Schrieffer]]) is the first [[microscopic theory]] of [[superconductivity]] since [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes| Heike Kamerlingh Onnes's]] 1911 discovery. The theory describes superconductivity as a microscopic effect caused by a [[Bose–Einstein condensate|condensation]] of [[Cooper pair]]s. The theory is also used in [[nuclear physics]] to describe the pairing interaction between [[nucleon]]s in an [[atomic nucleus]].

It was proposed by Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer in 1957; they received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this theory in 1972.

==History==
Rapid progress in the understanding of superconductivity gained momentum in the mid-1950s. It began with the 1948 paper, &quot;On the Problem of the Molecular Theory of Superconductivity&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=London|first=F.|title=On the Problem of the Molecular Theory of Superconductivity|journal=Physical Review|date=September 1948|volume=74|issue=5|pages=562–573|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.74.562|bibcode = 1948PhRv...74..562L }}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Fritz London]] proposed that the [[Phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenological]] [[London equations]] may be consequences of the [[quantum coherence|coherence]] of a [[quantum state]]. In 1953, [[Brian Pippard]], motivated by penetration experiments, proposed that this would modify the London equations via a new scale parameter called the [[Superconducting coherence length|coherence length]]. John Bardeen then argued in the 1955 paper, &quot;Theory of the Meissner Effect in Superconductors&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bardeen|first=J.|title=Theory of the Meissner Effect in Superconductors|journal=Physical Review|date=March 1955|volume=97|issue=6|pages=1724–1725|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.97.1724|bibcode = 1955PhRv...97.1724B }}&lt;!--|access-date=May 3, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; that such a modification naturally occurs in a theory with an energy gap. The key ingredient was Leon Cooper's calculation of the bound states of electrons subject to an attractive force in his 1956 paper, &quot;Bound Electron Pairs in a Degenerate Fermi Gas&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Leon|title=Bound Electron Pairs in a Degenerate Fermi Gas|journal=Physical Review|date=November 1956|volume=104|issue=4|pages=1189–1190|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.104.1189|issn=0031-899X|bibcode = 1956PhRv..104.1189C |doi-access=free}}&lt;!--|access-date=May 3, 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 Bardeen and Cooper assembled these ingredients and constructed such a theory, the BCS theory, with Robert Schrieffer. The theory was first published in April 1957 in the letter, &quot;Microscopic theory of superconductivity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bardeen|first=J.|author2=Cooper, L. N.|author3=Schrieffer, J.

In 1986, [[high-temperature superconductivity]] was discovered in La-Ba-Cu-O, at temperatures up to 30&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bednorz|first=J. G.|author2=Müller, K. A.|s2cid=118314311|title=Possible highT c superconductivity in the Ba−La−Cu−O system|journal=Zeitschrift für Physik B: Condensed Matter|date=June 1986|volume=64|doi=10.1007/BF01303701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following experiments determined more materials with transition temperatures up to about 130&amp;nbsp;K, considerably above the previous limit of about 30&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]. It is believed that BCS theory alone cannot explain this phenomenon and that other effects are in play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mann|first=A.|title=High Temperature Superconductivity at 25: Still In Suspense|journal=Nature|date=July 2011|volume=475|doi=10.1038/475280a|pmid=21776057|bibcode = 2011Natur.475..280M|issue=7356|pages=280–2|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; These effects are still not yet fully understood; it is possible that they even control superconductivity at low temperatures for some materials.

==Overview==
At sufficiently low temperatures, electrons near the [[Fermi surface]] become unstable against the formation of [[Cooper pair]]s. Cooper showed such binding will occur in the presence of an attractive potential, no matter how weak. In conventional superconductors, an attraction is generally attributed to an electron-lattice interaction. The BCS theory, however, requires only that the potential be attractive, regardless of its origin. In the BCS framework, superconductivity is a macroscopic effect which results from the condensation of Cooper pairs. These have some bosonic properties, and bosons, at sufficiently low temperature, can form a large [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]. Superconductivity was simultaneously explained by [[Nikolay Bogolyubov]], by means of the [[Bogoliubov transformation]]s.

In many superconductors, the attractive interaction between electrons (necessary for pairing) is brought about indirectly by the interaction between the electrons and the vibrating crystal lattice (the [[phonon]]s). Roughly speaking the picture is the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An electron moving through a conductor will attract nearby positive charges in the lattice. This deformation of the lattice causes another electron, with opposite spin, to move into the region of higher positive charge density. The two electrons then become correlated. Because there are a lot of such electron pairs in a superconductor, these pairs overlap very strongly and form a highly collective condensate. In this &quot;condensed&quot; state, the breaking of one pair will change the energy of the entire condensate - not just a single electron, or a single pair. Thus, the energy required to break any single pair is related to the energy required to break ''all'' of the pairs (or more than just two electrons). Because the pairing increases this energy barrier, kicks from oscillating atoms in the conductor (which are small at sufficiently low temperatures) are not enough to affect the condensate as a whole, or any individual &quot;member pair&quot; within the condensate. Thus the electrons stay paired together and resist all kicks, and the electron flow as a whole (the current through the superconductor) will not experience resistance. Thus, the collective behavior of the condensate is a crucial ingredient necessary for superconductivity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Details===
BCS theory starts from the assumption that there is some attraction between electrons, which can overcome the [[Coulomb repulsion]]. In most materials (in low temperature superconductors), this attraction is brought about indirectly by the coupling of electrons to the [[crystal lattice]] (as explained above). However, the results of BCS theory do ''not'' depend on the origin of the attractive interaction. For instance, Cooper pairs have been observed in [[Ultracold atom|ultracold gases]] of [[fermion]]s where a homogeneous [[magnetic field]] has been tuned to their [[Feshbach resonance]]. The original results of BCS (discussed below) described an [[Atomic orbital|s-wave]] superconducting state, which is the rule among low-temperature superconductors but is not realized in many unconventional superconductors such as the [[Atomic orbital|d-wave]] high-temperature superconductors.

Extensions of BCS theory exist to describe these other cases, although they are insufficient to completely describe the observed features of high-temperature superconductivity.

BCS is able to give an approximation for the quantum-mechanical many-body state of the system of (attractively interacting) electrons inside the metal. This state is now known as the BCS state. In the normal state of a metal, electrons move independently, whereas in the BCS state, they are bound into Cooper pairs by the attractive interaction. The BCS formalism is based on the reduced potential for the electrons' attraction. Within this potential, a variational [[ansatz]] for the wave function is proposed. This ansatz was later shown to be exact in the dense limit of pairs. Note that the continuous crossover between the dilute and dense regimes of attracting pairs of fermions is still an open problem, which now attracts a lot of attention within the field of ultracold gases.

===Underlying evidence===
The hyperphysics website pages at [[Georgia State University]] summarize some key background to BCS theory as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solids/bcs.html|title=BCS Theory of Superconductivity|website=hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|access-date=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Evidence of a [[band gap]] at the Fermi level''' (described as &quot;a key piece in the puzzle&quot;)
: the existence of a critical temperature and critical magnetic field implied a band gap, and suggested a [[phase transition]], but single [[electron]]s are forbidden from condensing to the same energy level by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. The site comments that &quot;a drastic change in conductivity demanded a drastic change in electron behavior&quot;. Conceivably, pairs of electrons might perhaps act like [[boson]]s instead, which are bound by [[Bose–Einstein statistics|different condensate rules]] and do not have the same limitation. 
*'''Isotope effect on the critical temperature, suggesting lattice interactions'''
: The [[Debye frequency]] of phonons in a lattice is proportional to the inverse of the square root of the mass of lattice ions. It was shown that the superconducting transition temperature of mercury indeed showed the same dependence, by substituting natural mercury &lt;sup&gt;202&lt;/sup&gt;Hg with a different isotope &lt;sup&gt;198&lt;/sup&gt;Hg.&lt;ref name=maxwell1950&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maxwell|first1=Emanuel|title=Isotope Effect in the Superconductivity of Mercury|journal=Physical Review|volume=78|issue=4|pages=477|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.78.477|bibcode = 1950PhRv...78..477M |year=1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''An [[Exponential growth|exponential rise]] in [[heat capacity]] near the critical temperature for some superconductors'''
: An exponential increase in heat capacity near the critical temperature also suggests an energy bandgap for the superconducting material. As superconducting [[vanadium]] is warmed toward its critical temperature, its heat capacity increases massively in a very few degrees; this suggests an energy gap being bridged by thermal energy.
* '''The lessening of the measured energy gap towards the critical temperature'''
: This suggests a type of situation where some kind of [[binding energy]] exists but it is gradually weakened as the temperature increases toward the critical temperature. A binding energy suggests two or more particles or other entities that are bound together in the superconducting state. This helped to support the idea of bound particles - specifically electron pairs - and together with the above helped to paint a general picture of paired electrons and their lattice interactions.

==Implications==
BCS derived several important theoretical predictions that are independent of the details of the interaction, since the quantitative predictions mentioned below hold for any sufficiently weak attraction between the electrons and this last condition is fulfilled for many low temperature superconductors - the so-called weak-coupling case. These have been confirmed in numerous experiments:
* The electrons are bound into Cooper pairs, and these pairs are correlated due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] for the electrons, from which they are constructed. Therefore, in order to break a pair, one has to change energies of all other pairs. This means there is an energy gap for single-particle excitation, unlike in the normal metal (where the state of an electron can be changed by adding an arbitrarily small amount of energy). This energy gap is highest at low temperatures but vanishes at the transition temperature when superconductivity ceases to exist. The BCS theory gives an expression that shows how the gap grows with the strength of the attractive interaction and the (normal phase) single particle [[density of states]] at the [[Fermi level]]. Furthermore, it describes how the density of states is changed on entering the superconducting state, where there are no electronic states any more at the Fermi level. The energy gap is most directly observed in tunneling experiments&lt;ref name=&quot;Giaever&quot;&gt;Ivar Giaever - Nobel Lecture. Nobelprize.org. Retrieved 16 Dec 2010. http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1973/giaever-lecture.html&lt;/ref&gt; and in reflection of microwaves from superconductors.
* BCS theory predicts the dependence of the value of the energy gap Δ at temperature ''T'' on the critical temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. The ratio between the value of the energy gap at zero temperature and the value of the superconducting transition temperature (expressed in energy units) takes the universal value&lt;ref name=&quot;Tinkham 1996 63&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

* Due to the energy gap, the [[specific heat]] of the superconductor is suppressed strongly ([[exponential decay|exponentially]]) at low temperatures, there being no thermal excitations left. However, before reaching the transition temperature, the specific heat of the superconductor becomes even higher than that of the normal conductor (measured immediately above the transition) and the ratio of these two values is found to be universally given by 2.5.
* BCS theory correctly predicts the [[Meissner effect]], i.e. the expulsion of a magnetic field from the superconductor and the variation of the penetration depth (the extent of the screening currents flowing below the metal's surface) with temperature. 
* It also describes the variation of the [[upper critical field|critical magnetic field]] (above which the superconductor can no longer expel the field but becomes normal conducting) with temperature. BCS theory relates the value of the critical field at zero temperature to the value of the transition temperature and the density of states at the Fermi level.
* In its simplest form, BCS gives the superconducting transition temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of the electron-phonon coupling potential ''V'' and the [[Debye frequency|Debye]] cutoff energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name=BCS_theory/&gt; &lt;math display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;k_{\rm B}\,T_{\rm c} = 1.134E_{\rm D}\,{e^{-1/N(0)\,V}},&lt;/math&gt; where ''N''(0) is the electronic density of states at the Fermi level. For more details, see [[Cooper pairs]].
* The BCS theory reproduces the '''isotope effect''', which is the experimental observation that for a given superconducting material, the critical temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the [[isotope]] used in the material. The isotope effect was reported by two groups on 24 March 1950, who discovered it independently working with different [[mercury (element)|mercury]] isotopes, although a few days before publication they learned of each other's results at the ONR conference in [[Atlanta]]. The two groups are [[Emanuel Maxwell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maxwell|first=Emanuel|date=1950-05-15| title=Isotope Effect in the Superconductivity of Mercury|journal=Physical Review|volume=78|issue=4|pages=477| doi=10.1103/PhysRev.78.477|bibcode=1950PhRv...78..477M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and C.

The '''biathlon''' is a [[winter sport]] that combines [[cross-country skiing (sport)|cross-country skiing]] and [[shooting sports|rifle shooting]]. It is treated as a race, with contestants skiing through a cross-country trail whose distance is divided into shooting rounds. The shooting rounds are not timed per se, but depending on the competition, missed shots result in extra distance or time being added to the contestant's total.

==History==
[[File:Skielober 1811.jpg|thumb|upright|Norwegian ski-soldier (Drawing published in 1811).]]
According to ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the biathlon &quot;is rooted in the skiing traditions of Scandinavia, where early inhabitants revered the [[Ullr|Norse god Ullr]] as both the ski god and the hunting god.&quot; In modern times, the activity that developed into this sport was an exercise for Norwegians as alternative training for the [[Norwegian army|military]]. Norwegian skiing regiments organized military skiing contests in the 18th century, divided into four classes: shooting at mark while skiing at top speed, downhill race among trees, downhill race on big hills without falling, and a long race on flat ground while carrying a rifle and military pack. In modern terminology, these military contests included downhill, slalom, biathlon, and cross-country skiing.&lt;ref name=Bergsland&gt;Bergsland, Einar (1946): ''På ski.'' Oslo: Aschehoug.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the world's first known ski clubs, ''Trysil Skytte- og Skiløberforening'' (the Trysil Rifle and Ski Club), was formed in Norway in 1861 to promote national defense at the local level. 20th century variants include {{lang|no|Forsvarsrennet}} (the military contest), a 17&amp;nbsp;km cross-country race with shooting, and the military cross-country race at 30&amp;nbsp;km including marksmanship. 

The modern biathlon is a civilian variant of the old military combined exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Bø, Olav: ''Skiing throughout history'', translated by W. Edson Richmond. Oslo: Samlaget, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; In Norway, the biathlon was until 1984 a branch of {{lang|no|Det frivillige Skyttervesen}}, an organization set up by the government to promote civilian marksmanship in support of national defence. In Norwegian, the biathlon is called {{lang|no|skiskyting}} (literally ''ski shooting'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Idrettsleksikon&quot;&gt;''Kunnskapsforlagets idrettsleksikon'' (Encyclopedia of Sports), Oslo: Kunnskapsforlaget, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; In Norway, there are still separate contests in {{lang|no|skifeltskyting}}, a cross-country race at 12&amp;nbsp;km with large-caliber rifle shooting at various targets with unknown range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bryhn|first=Rolf|title=skifeltskyting|date=2014-09-28|url=http://snl.no/skifeltskyting|work=Store norske leksikon|language=no|access-date=2018-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Called [[military patrol]], the combination of skiing and shooting was contested at the [[Winter Olympic Games]] in [[Military patrol at the 1924 Winter Olympics|1924]] and then [[demonstration sport|demonstrated]] in [[Military patrol at the 1928 Winter Olympics|1928]], [[Military patrol at the 1936 Winter Olympics|1936]], and [[Military patrol at the 1948 Winter Olympics|1948]], during which time Norway and Finland were strong competitors. In 1948, the sport was reorganized under the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne et Biathlon and became re-accepted as an Olympic sport in 1955,&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usbiathlon.org/history.html|title=Biathlon History|website=US Biathlon|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004044703/http://www.usbiathlon.org/history.html|archive-date=2011-10-04|access-date=2020-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; with widespread popularity within the Soviet and Swedish winter sport circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frank|first=William D.|date=June 2009|title=Cold War, Hot Borders: The Shooting War That the Russians Won|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KK6VKM0njdwC&amp;q=history+of+biathlon&amp;pg=PA41|journal=Skiing Heritage Journal|volume=21|issue=2|pages=36–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077G2TGQR|title=Two Skis and a Rifle: An Introduction to Biathlon|last=Nordvall|first=Michael|year=2017|isbn=978-1386671152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Biathlon World Championship]] was held in 1958 in [[Austria]], and in 1960 the sport was finally included in the [[1960 Winter Olympics|Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Idrettsleksikon&quot; /&gt; At [[1992 Winter Olympics|Albertville]] in 1992, women were first allowed in the Olympic biathlon. The pursuit format was added for the [[2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics]], and the IBU added mixed relay as a format for the [[2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Olympics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

The competitions from 1958 to 1965 used high-power [[centrefire]] [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]], such as the [[.30-06 Springfield]] and the [[7.62×51mm NATO]], before the [[.22 Long Rifle]] [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] cartridge was standardized in 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The ammunition was carried in a belt worn around the competitor's waist. The sole event was the men's 20&amp;nbsp;km individual, encompassing four separate ranges and firing distances of 100&amp;nbsp;m, 150&amp;nbsp;m, 200&amp;nbsp;m, and 250&amp;nbsp;m. The target distance was reduced to 150&amp;nbsp;m with the addition of the relay in 1966. The shooting range was further reduced to 50&amp;nbsp;m in 1978 with the mechanical self-indicating targets making their debut at the [[1980 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/biathlon-a-sport-on-the-cutting-edge|title=Biathlon: a sport on the cutting edge|date=23 February 2015|work=olympic.org|access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2018–2019 season, fully [[electronic target]]s were approved as an alternative to paper or mechanical steel targets for IBU events.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biathlonworld.com/news/detail/new-season-new-rules New Season, New Rules: International Biathlon Union – IBU]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governing body==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ole Einar Bjørndalen]] --&gt;
In 1948, the [[Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne|International Modern Pentathlon Union]] (UIPM) was founded to standardize the rules for the [[modern pentathlon]] and from 1953 also biathlon. In July 1993, the biathlon branch of the UIPMB created the [[International Biathlon Union]] (IBU), which officially separated from the UIPMB in 1998.

Presidents of the UIPMB/IBU:

The complete rules of the biathlon are given in the official IBU rule books.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

===Basic concepts===
A biathlon competition consists of a race in which contestants ski through a cross-country trail system whose total distance is divided into either two or four shooting rounds, half in the prone position, the other half standing. Depending on the shooting performance, extra distance or time is added to the contestant's total skiing distance/time. The contestant with the shortest total time wins.

For each shooting round, the biathlete must hit five targets or receive a penalty for each missed target, which varies according to the competition rules as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

* Skiing around a {{cvt|150|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} penalty loop—typically taking 20–30 seconds for elite biathletes to complete, depending on weather and snow conditions.
* Adding one minute to the skier's total time.
* Use of an extra cartridge (placed at the shooting range) to hit the target; only three such extras are available for each round, and a penalty loop must be done for each target left standing.

In order to keep track of the contestants' progress and relative standing throughout a race, [[Fully automatic time|split time]]s (intermediate times) are taken at several points along the skiing track and upon finishing each shooting round. The large display screens commonly set up at biathlon arenas, as well as the information graphics shown as part of the TV picture, will typically list the split time of the fastest contestant at each intermediate point and the times and time differences to the closest runners-up.

===Skiing details===
In the Olympics, all cross-country skiing techniques are permitted in the biathlon, allowing the use of [[Cross-country skiing#Skate skiing|skate skiing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/pyeongchang-2018/results/resOWG2018/pdf/OWG2018/BTH/OWG2018_DT_BCK__BTH-------------------------------_1220_ENG.pdf|title=Competition format and rules: Biathlon, as of January 2018|date=2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213022253/https://www.olympic.org/pyeongchang-2018/results/resOWG2018/pdf/OWG2018/BTH/OWG2018_DT_BCK__BTH-------------------------------_1220_ENG.pdf|archive-date=2018-02-13|url-status=dead|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is overwhelmingly the choice of competitors. The minimum ski length is the height of the skier minus 4&amp;nbsp;cm. The rifle has to be carried by the skier during the race at all times.

===Shooting details===
[[File:2018-01-06 IBU Biathlon World Cup Oberhof 2018 - Pursuit Men 70.jpg|thumb|Biathlon coaches use [[spotting scope]]s to verify and optimize competitors shot placement]]

The biathlete carries a small-bore rifle, which must weigh at least {{convert|3.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, excluding ammunition and magazines. The rifles use [[.22 Long Rifle|.22 LR]] ammunition and are [[bolt action]] or [[Bolt action#Straight_pull|Fortner]] (straight-pull bolt) action. Each rifle holds 4 magazines with 5 rounds each. Additional rounds can be kept on the stock of the rifle for a relay race.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ffs.fr/pdf/reglements/REGBIATH/FFSreg-biat6a.pdf|title=IBU Rules|last=11TH Regular IBU Congress|date=2014|website=International Biathlon Union|pages=4-8, 4-9|access-date=2018-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The target range shooting distance is {{convert|50|m|yd|abbr=on}}. There are five circular [[shooting target]]s to be hit in each shooting round. When shooting in the [[prone position]], the target diameter is {{convert|45|mm|in|abbr=on}}; when shooting in the standing position, the target diameter is {{convert|115|mm|in|abbr=on}}. This translates to angular target sizes of 0.9 and 2.3 [[milliradian|mrad]] respectively. On all modern biathlon ranges, the targets are self-indicating, in that they flip from black to white when hit, giving the biathlete, as well as the spectators, instant visual feedback for each shot fired.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Ear protection is not required during biathlon shooting as the ammunition used is usually [[Subsonic ammunition|subsonic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jacksonbiathlon.org/?content=the_basics/top_10_questions|title=Top 10 Questions|last=Staff|date=2018|website=Jackson Biathlon|access-date=2018-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; An eyecup (blinder) is an optional feature of [[biathlon rifle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.anchoragenordicski.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CoachesEducation.pdf|title=US Biathlon Association Coaches' Education|last=Staff|website=www.anchoragenordicski.com|publisher=US Biathlon|pages=6|access-date=2018-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition format==

===Individual===
The {{cvt|20|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} individual race [{{cvt|15|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} for women] is the oldest biathlon event; the distance is skied over five laps. The biathlete shoots four times at any shooting lane (lanes 1–15 are in prone, while lanes 16–30 are for standing),&lt;ref&gt;Even in English-speaking countries such as Canada and the United States, each country may use different terms for the same thing in biathlon. For example, Stage (USA) vs. Bout (Canada), Shooting Point (USA) vs. Shooting Lane (Canada)&lt;/ref&gt; in the order of prone, standing, prone, standing, totaling 20 targets. For each missed target, a fixed penalty time, usually one minute, is added to the skiing time of the biathlete. Competitors' starts are staggered, normally by 30 seconds.

A variation of the standard individual race, called short individual, was introduced during the [[2018–19 Biathlon IBU Cup]]. The races are 15&amp;nbsp;km for men and 12.5&amp;nbsp;km for women, and for each missed target, 45 seconds will be added to the skiing time.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biathlonworld.com/news/detail/some-changes-at-the-ibu-cup|title=Some Changes at the IBU Cup|website=International Biathlon Union - IBU|access-date=2019-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sprint===
The sprint is {{cvt|10|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} for men &amp;  {{cvt|7.5|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} for women; the distance is skied over three laps. The biathlete shoots twice at any shooting lane, once prone (usually lanes 1–15) and once standing (lanes 16–30), for a total of 10 shots. For each miss, a penalty loop of 150&amp;nbsp;m must be skied before continuing the race. As in the individual competition, the biathletes start in intervals.

=== Super Sprint ===
Introduced at the [[2017–18 Biathlon IBU Cup]], the Super Sprint is a shorter version of the sprint race. Unlike the traditional sprint race, the Super Sprint is divided into two segments – qualification and final. The qualification is done like the traditional sprint, but on a 1.5&amp;nbsp;km lap with a total length of 4.5&amp;nbsp;km. Only the top 30 competitors qualify for the final, in which all competitors start simultaneously and do five laps on the same course (like in mass start) with a total race length of 4&amp;nbsp;km. During the final, the competitors have three spare rounds should they miss a target (like in relay race). However, if not all targets are cleared during shooting instead of going on the penalty loop, the biathlete is disqualified from the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biathlonworld.com/about-biathlon/disciplines/super-sprint-this-is-really-fast|title=International Biathlon Union - IBU|website=International Biathlon Union - IBU|access-date=2019-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes were made for the following season with the course now being 1&amp;nbsp;km (0.2&amp;nbsp;km increase) meaning that the qualification race length will become 3&amp;nbsp;km,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://res.cloudinary.com/deltatre-spa-ibu/image/upload/rdartycf3i2pnqx1fitg.pdf|title=International Biathlon Union Event and Competition Rules|website=International Biathlon Union|access-date=2019-11-07|archive-date=2019-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214070500/http://res.cloudinary.com/deltatre-spa-ibu/image/upload/rdartycf3i2pnqx1fitg.pdf|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the final race becomes 5&amp;nbsp;km in length. Also the number of spare rounds was decreased from three to one.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

===Pursuit===
[[File:Biathlon Oberhof 2013-039.jpg|thumb|right|World Cup pursuit race in [[Oberhof, Germany]], 2013.]]

{{main|Pursuit racing}}
In a pursuit, biathletes' starts are separated by their time differences from a previous race,&lt;ref&gt;Pursuit competition start intervals are determined by [[Rounding#Rounding to integer|common rounding]] to the nearest whole second of the biathletes' time differences from the previous race{{spaced ndash}} the amount of time each biathlete lagged after the winner to the finish line.&lt;/ref&gt; most commonly a sprint. The contestant crossing the finish line first is the winner. The distance is 12.5&amp;nbsp;km for men and 10&amp;nbsp;km for women, skied over five laps; there are four shooting bouts (two prone, two standing, in that order) and each miss means a penalty loop of 150&amp;nbsp;m. To prevent awkward or dangerous crowding of the skiing loops and overcapacity at the shooting range, World Cup Pursuits are held with only the 60 top-ranking biathletes after the preceding race. The biathletes shoot on a first-come, first-served basis at the lane corresponding to the position they arrived for all shooting bouts. If the pursuit follows an individual biathlon race, the lag behind the winner is halved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://res.cloudinary.com/deltatre-spa-ibu/image/upload/nk93tbz7syaoj02qmjod.pdf|title=International Biathlon Union Event And Competition Rules|publisher=International Biathlon Union|at=p.27;sec.1.7.6|quote-page=27|quote=The winner of the qualifying competition will have a start time of zero (0) which will be shown on the start list as the clock time for the start of the Pursuit competition. The remaining competitors in the Pursuit competition will have as their start time the actual time by which they were behind the winner in the Sprint or Mass Start competition or – in the Individual – one half of the time behind the winner, expressed in time behind to the nearest whole second.|access-date=2021-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass start===
In the mass start, all biathletes start at the same time, and the first across the finish line wins. In this 15&amp;nbsp;km for men or 12.5&amp;nbsp;km for women competition, the distance is skied over five laps; there are four bouts of shooting (two prone, two standing, in that order), with the first shooting bout being at the lane corresponding to the competitor's bib number (bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race), with the rest of the shooting bouts being on a first-come, first-served basis (if a competitor arrives at the lane in fifth place, they shoot at lane 5). As in sprint and pursuit, competitors must ski one 150&amp;nbsp;m penalty loop for each miss. Here again, to avoid unwanted congestion, World Cup Mass starts are held with only the 30 top ranking athletes on the start line (half that of the Pursuit as here all contestants start simultaneously).

===Mass start 60===
Starting in the [[2018–19 Biathlon IBU Cup|2018/2019 season]], the Mass Start 60 became part of the [[International Biathlon Union]] (IBU) competition formats. The Mass Start with 60 starters does not replace the current Mass Start with 30 starters.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

Everyone skis the first lap together, but only the first 30 stop to shoot, and the second 30 keep skiing. At the end of the second lap, the second 30 stop to shoot, and the first 30 continue to ski. After the first two shoots are over (everyone's first prone), the race continues like a typical race, and all competitors shoot remaining prone, and two stands together. Or more simply:

Bib 1–30 = lap, shoot1, lap, lap, shoot2, lap, shoot3, lap, shoot4, lap

Bib 31–60 = lap, lap, shoot1, lap, shoot2, lap, shoot3, lap, shoot4, lap&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biathlon23.wordpress.com/tag/ibu-cup-martell/|title=I (BU) got new rules, I count 'em!|date=October 28, 2018|website=biathlon23|language=en|access-date=2018-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relay===
The relay teams consist of four biathletes, who each ski 7.5&amp;nbsp;km (men) or 6&amp;nbsp;km (women), each leg skied over three laps, with two shooting rounds; one prone, one standing. For every round of five targets, there are eight bullets available. However, the last three can only be single-loaded manually one at a time from spare round holders or bullets deposited by the competitor into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If there are still standing targets after eight bullets, one 150&amp;nbsp;m (490&amp;nbsp;ft) penalty loop must be taken for each missed target remaining. The first-leg participants all start simultaneously, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of their position in the race), then for the remainder of the relay, the relay team shoots on a first-come, first-served basis (arrive at the range in fifth place, shoot at lane 5).

===Mixed relay===
The mixed relay is similar to the ordinary relay, but the teams are composed of two women and two men. From its first instance at the [[Biathlon World Championships 2005|world championships]] in 2005 until the end of the [[2017–18 Biathlon World Cup|2017 season]], the first two legs were always run by the women, followed by the men on legs 3 and 4. Since the [[2017–18 Biathlon World Cup|2018 season]] however, the race can be started by either the men or women .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=IBU|title=New Season, New Rules|url=https://www.biathlonworld.com/news/detail/new-season-new-rules|date=2018-08-02|access-date=2021-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, throughout most the event's history, the women's legs have been {{convert|6|km|abbr=on}} and the men's legs {{convert|7.5|km|abbr=on}} as in ordinary relay competitions. However, since the [[2019–20 Biathlon World Cup|2019 season]] the event has all four legs being either {{convert|6|km|abbr=on}} or {{convert|7.5|km|abbr=on}}.
This event was added to the Olympics starting in [[Biathlon at the 2014 Winter Olympics – Mixed relay|2014]].

===Single mixed relay===
In 2015, the single mixed relay was introduced to the Biathlon World Cup by the IBU. The event is run on a {{convert|1.5|km|abbr=on}} track with a {{convert|75|m|abbr=on}} penalty loop, and each team consists of a female and a male runner.&lt;ref name=&quot;singlemixedrelay&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.biathlonworld.com/about-biathlon/disciplines/single-mixed-relay-an-exciting-novelty |title=Single Mixed Relay: an Exciting New Format |website=International Biathlon Union - IBU |access-date=16 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The race is divided into four legs, with the first three being {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} or 2 laps and the final leg being {{convert|4.5|km|abbr=on}} or 3 laps, totalling {{convert|13.5|km|abbr=on}}. After each leg, the runners exchange so that each runner completes two legs. Specific to this format, the exchange happens immediately after the last shooting of each leg without skiing an additional lap (as is usually the case). The race can be started by either the female or male member of the relay,&lt;ref name=&quot;singlemixedrelay&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with the finishing member performing an extra lap. This event was added to the world championships in [[Biathlon World Championships 2019|2019]].

===Team (obsolete)===
A team consists of four biathletes, but unlike the relay competition, all team members start at the same time. Two athletes must shoot in the prone shooting round, the other two in the standing round. In case of a miss, the two non-shooting biathletes must ski a penalty loop of 150&amp;nbsp;m (490&amp;nbsp;ft). The skiers must enter the shooting area together and must also finish within 15 seconds of each other; otherwise, a time penalty of one minute is added to the total time. Since 2004, this race format has been obsolete at the World Cup level.

==Broadcasting==
Biathlon events are broadcast most regularly where the sport enjoys its greatest popularity, namely Germany ([[Das Erste|ARD]], [[ZDF]]), Austria ([[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]), Norway ([[Norsk Rikskringkasting|NRK]]), France ([[L'Équipe (TV channel)|L'Équipe 21]]), Finland ([[Yleisradio|YLE]]), [[Estonia]] ([[ETV (Estonia)|ETV]]), [[Latvia]] ([[LTV 7|LTV]]), [[Lithuania]] ([[Lithuanian National Radio and Television|LRT]]), [[Croatia]] ([[Hrvatska radiotelevizija|HRT]]), Poland ([[Polsat]]), Ukraine ([[UA:PBC]]), Sweden ([[Sveriges Television|SVT]]), Russia ([[Match TV]], [[Channel One Russia|Channel One]]), [[Belarus]] ([[TVR (Belarus)|TVR]]), [[Slovenia]] ([[RTV Slovenia|RTV]]), [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] ([[Radio-televizija Bosne i Hercegovine|BHRT]]), [[Bulgaria]] ([[Bulgarian National Television|BNT]]), and [[South Korea]] ([[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]]);&lt;!--sequence held in same order as on biathlonworld.com--&gt; it is broadcast on European-wide [[Eurosport]], which also broadcasts to the Asia-Pacific region. World Cup races are streamed via the IBU website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biathlonworld.com/|title=IBU|last=Staff|website=International Biathlon Union|access-date=2018-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The broadcast distribution being one indicator, the constellation of a sport's main [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] usually gives a similar, and correlated, indication of popularity: for biathlon, these are the Germany-based companies [[BMW]] (cars), [[Erdinger]] (beer), [[Viessmann]] (boilers and other heating systems) and [[Deutsche Kreditbank|DKB]] (banking).

==Biathlon records and statistics==
The IBU maintains biathlon records, rules, news, videos, and statistics for many years back, all of which are available at its web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
